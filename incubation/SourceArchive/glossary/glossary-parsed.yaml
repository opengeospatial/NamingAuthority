term: Coverage
definition: |-
  Coverage is a feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain. [Source: ISO 19123:2005, 4.1.7]
  Coverages are represented by some binary or ASCII serialization, specified by some data (en­coding) format. Arguably the most popular type of coverage is that of a gridded coverage. Gridded coverages have a grid as their domain set describing the direct positions in multi-dimensional coordinate space, depending on the type of grid. Satellite imagery is typically modelled as a gridded coverage, for example. [Source: https://ogcapi.ogc.org/coverages/]

term: OGC API

  The OGC API family of standards are being developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial data to the web. These standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web Service standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, etc.), but define resource-centric APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices. This web page provides information on these standards in a consolidated location.
  These standards are being constructed as "building blocks" that can be used to assemble novel APIs for web access to geospatial content. The building blocks are defined not only by the requirements of the specific standards, but also through interoperability prototyping and testing in OGC's Innovation Program.
