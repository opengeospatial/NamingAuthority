        "content": "The ability of an optical filter (or optical system) to reject optical energy outside the desired wavelengths/frequencies is referred to as \"out-of-band (OOB) blocking\". This can also refer to filter design specifications regarding the ability to reject optical energy outside the desired filter bandpass."
