=== error of measurement

measured quantity value minus a reference quantity value

NOTE: The concept of "measurement error" can be used both a) when there is a single reference quantity value to refer to, which occurs if a calibration is made by means of a measurement standard with a measured quantity value having a negligible measurement uncertainty or if a conventional quantity value is given, in which case the measurement error is known, and b) if a measurand is supposed to be represented by a unique true quantity value or a set of true quantity values of negligible range, in which case the measurement error is not known.

NOTE: Measurement error should not be confused with production error or mistake.
