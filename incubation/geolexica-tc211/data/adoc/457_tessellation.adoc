=== tessellation

partitioning of a space into a set of conterminous subspaces having the same dimension as the space being partitioned

NOTE: A tessellation composed of congruent regular polygons or polyhedra is a regular tessellation. One composed of regular, but non-congruent polygons or polyhedra is a semi-regular tessellation. Otherwise the tessellation is irregular.
