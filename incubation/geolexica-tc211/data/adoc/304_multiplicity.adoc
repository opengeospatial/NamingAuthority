=== multiplicity <UML>

specification of the range of allowable cardinalities that a set may assume

NOTE: Multiplicity specifications may be given for roles within associations, parts within composites, repetitions and other purposes. Essentially a multiplicity is a (possibly infinite) subset of the non-negative integers. Contrast: cardinality.
