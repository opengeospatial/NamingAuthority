=== directed node

directed topological object that represents an association between a node and one of its orientations

NOTE: Directed nodes are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association between edge and node. The orientation of a node is with respect to an edge, "+" for end node, "-" for start node. This is consistent with the vector notion of "result = end - start".
