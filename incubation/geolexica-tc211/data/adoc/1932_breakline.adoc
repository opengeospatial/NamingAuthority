=== breakline

linear feature that describes a change in the smoothness or continuity of a surface

NOTE: A soft breakline ensures that known z-values along a linear feature are maintained (for example, elevations along a pipeline, road centreline or drainage ditch), and ensures that linear features and polygon edges are maintained in a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface model, by enforcing the breaklines as TIN edges. They are generally synonymous with 3-D breaklines because they are depicted with series of x/y/z coordinates. Somewhat rounded ridges or the trough of a drain may be collected using soft breaklines.

NOTE: A hard breakline defines interruptions in surface smoothness, for example, to define streams, shorelines, dams, ridges, building footprints, and other locations with abrupt surface changes.
