=== chain of agency

sequence of agency where the agent in each relationship is the principal of the next in the chain

NOTE: A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a transitive agency between the agent of the first link and the principal of the last. This chain can be spoken of in either direction, either as “principal -> agent = principal -> agent” (normal or granting order) or “agent -> principal = agent -> principal” (reverse, acceptance, verification or tracing order).
