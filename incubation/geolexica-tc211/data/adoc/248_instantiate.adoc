=== instantiate

to represent (an abstraction) by the creation of a concrete instance or to create the ability to create an instance

NOTE: A class or data element definition instantiates a type if it creates the ability to create objects or data elements respectively, that can represent the concepts (instance data and /or operations) defined by that type. A class is instantiated by an object if the class defines that object's structure and function. A data schema is instantiated by a data element if the data schema defines that element's structure.
