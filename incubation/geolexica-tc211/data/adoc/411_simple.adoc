=== simple

property of a geometric object that its interior is isotropic (all points have isomorphic neighbourhoods), and hence everywhere locally isomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate dimension

NOTE: This implies that no interior direct position is involved in a self-intersection of any kind.
