=== rights holder

principal that owns the right to license rights to a resource

NOTE: Rights can be by law (copyright), by agreement, or by contract [the licence agreement]. In the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences are adhered to, and that rights holders are compensated as appropriate for each transaction. Agents of the original rights holder can also issue licences, but their ability is only under the agency contract to the original principal.
