=== scan mode

SAR mode in which the antenna beam is steered to illuminate a swath of ground at various angles relative to flight path throughout the collection

NOTE: Steering the antenna also allows dwell time to be increased and provides the ability to collect strips at angles non-parallel to the flight direction and with better resolution than Stripmap mode.
