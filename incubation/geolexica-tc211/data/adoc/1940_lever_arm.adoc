=== lever arm

relative position vector of one sensor with respect to another in a direct georeferencing system

NOTE: For example, with aerial mapping cameras, there are lever arms between the inertial centre of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and the phase centre of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna, each with respect to the camera perspective centre within the lens of the camera.
