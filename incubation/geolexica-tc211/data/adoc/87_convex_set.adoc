=== convex set

geometric set in which any direct position on the straight-line segment joining any two direct positions in the geometric set is also contained in the geometric set

NOTE: Convex sets are "simply connected", meaning that they have no interior holes, and can normally be considered topologically isomorphic to a Euclidean ball of the appropriate dimension. So the surface of a sphere can be considered to be geodesically convex.
