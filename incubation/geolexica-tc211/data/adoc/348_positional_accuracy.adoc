=== positional accuracy

closeness of coordinate value to the true or accepted value in a specified reference system

NOTE: The phrase "absolute accuracy" is sometimes used for this concept to distinguish it from relative positional accuracy.  Where the true coordinate value may not be perfectly known, accuracy is normally tested by comparison to available values that can best be accepted as true.
