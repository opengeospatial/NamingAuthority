=== coverage

feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain

NOTE: In other words, a coverage is a feature that has multiple values for each attribute type, where each direct position within the geometric representation of the feature has a single value for each attribute type.
