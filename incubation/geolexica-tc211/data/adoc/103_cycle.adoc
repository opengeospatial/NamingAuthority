=== cycle<geometry>

spatial object without a boundary

NOTE: Cycles are used to describe boundary components (see shell, ring). A cycle has no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not have infinite extent).  A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary, but is bounded.
