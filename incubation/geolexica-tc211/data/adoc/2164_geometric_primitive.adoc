=== geometric primitive <geometry>

geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous (isotropic) element of space

NOTE: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information about geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and solids. Many geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting the same interfaces defined for geometric primitives) but are actually composites composed of some number of other primitives. General collections may be aggregates and incapable of acting like a primitive (such as the lines of a complex network, which is not connected and thus incapable of being traceable as a single line). By this definition, a geometric primitive is topological open, since the boundary points are not isotropic to the interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For points, the boundary is empty.
