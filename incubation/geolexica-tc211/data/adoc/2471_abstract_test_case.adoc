=== abstract test case

test for a particular requirement or a set of related requirements

NOTE: An abstract or conformance test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome.

NOTE: The definition for "test case" can be found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017, 3.4210.
