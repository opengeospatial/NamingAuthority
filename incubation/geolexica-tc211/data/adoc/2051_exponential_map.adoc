=== exponential map <differential geometry>

function that maps tangent vectors at a point to end point of geodesic beginning at that point with an exit bearing equal to that of the vector and a length equal to that of the vector

NOTE: See first geodetic problem for an explanation of the process of calculating this mapping.
