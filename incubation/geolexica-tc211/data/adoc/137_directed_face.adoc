=== directed face

directed topological object that represents an association between a face and one of its orientations

NOTE: The orientation of the directed edges that compose the exterior boundary of a directed face will appear positive from the direction of this vector; the orientation of a directed face that bounds a topological solid will point away from the topological solid. Adjacent solids would use different orientations for their shared boundary, consistent with the same sort of association between adjacent faces and their shared edges. Directed faces are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association between face and edge.
