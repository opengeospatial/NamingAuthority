=== vertical reference frame

reference frame describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths to the Earth

NOTE: In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea level. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths.

NOTE: Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
