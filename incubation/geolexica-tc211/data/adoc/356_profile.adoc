=== profile

set of one or more base standards or subsets of base standards, and, where applicable, the identification of chosen clauses, classes, options and parameters of those base standards, that are necessary for accomplishing a particular function

NOTE: A profile is derived from base standards so that by definition, conformance to a profile is conformance to the base standards from which it is derived.
