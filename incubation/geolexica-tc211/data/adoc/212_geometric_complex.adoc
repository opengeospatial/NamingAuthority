=== geometric complex

set of disjoint geometric primitives where the boundary of each geometric primitive can be represented as the union of other geometric primitives of smaller dimension within the same set

NOTE: The geometric primitives in the set are disjoint in the sense that no direct position is interior to more than one geometric primitive. The set is closed under boundary operations, meaning that for each element in the geometric complex, there is a collection (also a geometric complex) of geometric primitives that represents the boundary of that element. Recall that the boundary of a point (the only 0D primitive object type in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the largest dimension geometric primitive is a solid (3D), the composition of the boundary operator in this definition terminates after at most three steps. It is also the case that the boundary of any object is a cycle.
