=== geodesic circle <differential geometry, geodesy>

set of points an equal distance from a given point (on the datum)

NOTE: The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of constant latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin (corresponding to the point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the exponential map on the geometric reference surface centred on the point of tangency.
