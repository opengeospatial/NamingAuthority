=== boundary face string

boundary forming part of the outside of a spatial unit

NOTE: Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial units by means of line strings in 2D. This 2D representation is a 2D boundary in a 2D land administration system. In a 3D land administration system it represents a series of vertical boundary faces  where an unbounded volume is assumed, surrounded by boundary faces which intersect the Earthâ€™s surface (such as traditionally depicted in the cadastral map).
