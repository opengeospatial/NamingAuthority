=== auxiliary data <earth observation>

data which enhance processing and utilization of the Earth observing instrument data

NOTE: The auxiliary data are not captured by the same data collection process as the instrument data. Auxiliary data include data collected by any other platform or process, preferably in georeferenced digital format. Auxiliary data help in data processing, but are also datasets in their own right.

NOTE: Adapted from Reference [8].
