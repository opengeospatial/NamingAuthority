=== measurement uncertainty

parameter, associated with the result of measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand

NOTE: Uncertainty of measurement comprises, in general, many components. Some of these components may be evaluated from the statistical distribution of the results of series of measurements and can be characterized by experimental standard deviations. The other components, which can also be characterized by standard deviations, are evaluated from assumed probability distributions based on experience or other information.
