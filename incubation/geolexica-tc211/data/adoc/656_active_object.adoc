=== active object

object which is capable of independent actions, and therefore capable of initiating interactions between itself and other objects without immediate prior external stimulation

NOTE: cf. passive object. An active object can represent a user, or an active service that depends on internal (and therefore not visible) triggers to start actions. Active and passive states can exist for the same object, and such a service can transition between these two states depending on invocation of an activation or deactivation operation protocol.
