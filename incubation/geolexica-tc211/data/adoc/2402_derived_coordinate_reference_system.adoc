=== derived coordinate reference system

coordinate reference system that is defined through the application of a specified coordinate conversion to the coordinates within a previously established coordinate reference system

NOTE: The previously established coordinate reference system is referred to as the base coordinate reference system.

NOTE: The coordinate conversion between the base and derived coordinate reference system is implemented using the parameters and formula(s) specified in the definition of the coordinate conversion.
