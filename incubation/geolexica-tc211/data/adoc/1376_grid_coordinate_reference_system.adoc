=== grid coordinate reference system

coordinate reference system for the positions in a grid that uses a defined coordinate system congruent with the coordinate system described by the GridEnvelope and axisLabels of gml:GridType

NOTE: A grid CRS uses a defined coordinate system with the same grid point positions and origin as the GridEnvelope, with the same axisLabels, but need not define any limits on the grid size. This coordinate system is sometimes called the internal grid coordinate system.
