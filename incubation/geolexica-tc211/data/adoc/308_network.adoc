=== network

abstract structure consisting of a set of 0-dimensional objects called junctions, and a set of 1-dimensional objects called links that connect the junctions, each link being associated with a start (origin, source) junction and end (destination, sink) junction

NOTE: The network is essentially the universe of discourse for the navigation problem.  Networks are a variety of 1-dimensional topological complex. In this light, junction and topological node are synonyms, as are link and directed edge.
