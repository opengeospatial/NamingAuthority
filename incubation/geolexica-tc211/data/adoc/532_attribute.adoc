=== attribute <XML>

name-value pair contained in an element

NOTE: In this document an attribute is an XML attribute unless otherwise specified. The syntax of an XML attribute is  "Attribute::= Name = AttValue". An attribute typically acts as an XML element modifier (e.g.  <Road gml:id = "r1" />; here gml:id is an attribute.
