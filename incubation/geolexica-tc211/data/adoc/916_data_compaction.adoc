=== data compaction

reduction of the number of data elements, bandwidth, cost, and time for the generation, transmission, and storage of data without loss of information by eliminating unnecessary redundancy, removing irrelevancy, or using special coding

NOTE: Whereas data compaction reduces the amount of data used to represent a given amount of information, data compression does not.

NOTE: Data compaction can be done through aggregation of like values in adjacent grid cells, tiling schemes or other means of eliminating information that is not relevant.
