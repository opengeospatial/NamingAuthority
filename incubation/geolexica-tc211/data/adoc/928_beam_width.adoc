=== beam width <SAR>

useful angular width of the beam of electromagnetic energy

NOTE: Beam width is usually measured in radians and as the angular width between two points that have 50% of the power (3 dB below) of the centre of the beam. It is a property of the antenna. Power emitted outside of this angle is too little to provide a usable return.
