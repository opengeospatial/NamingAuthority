=== zone <DGGS>

particular region of space-time

NOTE: The primitives of zone are spatial location (3.31) and temporal period (3.34).

NOTE: A zone may be either a single zonal primitive or a compound zone comprising one spatial location and one temporal period. Zones can be regions of space-time associated with any celestial body.

NOTE: Zones are the primary container for storing and retrieving data within a DGGS implementation. DGGSs reference zones by their zonal identifier (3.50), for instance in databases or through tile nomenclature.

NOTE: Each zone's geometry is represented by a cell
