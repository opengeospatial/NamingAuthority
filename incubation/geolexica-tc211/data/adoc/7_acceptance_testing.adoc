=== acceptance testing <user>

process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance criteria and enables the user to determine whether to accept the implementation

NOTE: This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g. functional, volume, performance tests) that demonstrate that the implementation satisfies the user requirements.

NOTE: This is not a part of conformance testing
