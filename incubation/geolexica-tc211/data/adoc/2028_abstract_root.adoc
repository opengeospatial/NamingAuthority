=== abstract root <programming>

common root classifier of a category which is a superclass of any other classifier in the category

NOTE: The class Any in some programming languages is the abstract root of all classes. Thus, it is the de facto union of all classes. In this document, Geometry is the (named and explicit) abstract root for all geometry objects. In the package Geometry and any of its subpackages (including those in its Requirements Classes), any interface will be a subtype of Geometry either directly or transitively.
