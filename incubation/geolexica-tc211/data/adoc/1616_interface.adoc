=== interface <UML>

classifier that represents a declaration of a set of coherent public <UML> features and obligations

NOTE: An interface specifies a contract; any classifier that realizes the interface must fulfil that contract. The obligations that can be associated with an interface are in the form of various kinds of constraints (such as pre- and post-conditions) or protocol specifications, which can impose ordering restrictions on interactions through the interface.
