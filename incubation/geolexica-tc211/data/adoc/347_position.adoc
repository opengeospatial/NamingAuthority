=== position

data type that describes a point or geometry potentially occupied by an object or person

NOTE: A direct position is a semantic subtype of position. Direct positions as described can only define a point and therefore not all positions can be represented by a direct position. That is consistent with the "is type of" relation.  An 19107 geometry is also a position, just not a direct position.
