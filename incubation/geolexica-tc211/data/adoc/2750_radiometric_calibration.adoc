=== radiometric calibration

process of deriving coefficients, identifying and describing behaviours, and characterizing all aspects of a remote sensing instrument to relate the response of the sensor to a known quantity of flux entering the system

NOTE: A system that has undergone this process can then infer the value of an unknown quantity of flux based on the response of the instrument.
