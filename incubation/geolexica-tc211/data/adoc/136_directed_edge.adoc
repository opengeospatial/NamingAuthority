=== directed edge

directed topological object that represents an association between an edge and one of its orientations

NOTE: A directed edge that is in agreement with the orientation of the edge has a + orientation, otherwise, it has the opposite (-) orientation. Directed edge is used in topology to distinguish the right side (-) from the left side (+) of the same edge and the start node (-) and end node (+) of the same edge and in computational topology to represent these concepts.
