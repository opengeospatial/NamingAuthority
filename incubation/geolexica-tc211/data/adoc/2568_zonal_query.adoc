=== zonal query <DGGS>

geometry or topology function using a cell's zonal identifiers to specify geometry

NOTE: ISO 19107 specifies a suite of geometry and topology functions in the Query2D and Query3D classes, where geometry elements used in each function's parameters are described by sets of coordinates. In DGGS all geometry can be referenced as sets of cells (3.2) represented solely by a list (or set) of their zonal identifiers. This document specifies ZoneQuery to implement the operations in both Query2D and Query3D using zonal identifiers to reference each operation's source and target geometry.
