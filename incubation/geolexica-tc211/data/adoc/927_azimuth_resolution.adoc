=== azimuth resolution <SAR>

resolution in the cross-range direction

NOTE: This is usually measured in terms of the impulse response of the SAR sensor and processing system. It is a function of the size of the synthetic aperture, or alternatively the dwell time (i.e. a larger aperture results in a longer dwell time results in better resolution).
