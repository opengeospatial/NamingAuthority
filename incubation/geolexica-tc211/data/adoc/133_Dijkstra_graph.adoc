=== Dijkstra graph

positively weighted directed graph appropriately configured to execute a shortest path search

NOTE: The term comes from the most commonly known algorithm for finding a shortest path in a positively weighted graph, from E. Dijkstra's paper [7]. Although this algorithm is not the only one in use, the requirements for the graph are common to most. The most common relaxation of the requirement is the "positive weights," which are not needed in the Bellman-Ford algorithm [4], [8].
