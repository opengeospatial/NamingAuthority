=== coboundary

set of topological primitives of higher topological dimension associated with a particular topological object, such that this topological object is in each of their boundaries

NOTE: If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary of that node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations would also be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end node of the edge (defined as the end of the positive directed edge), then the positive orientation of the node (defined as the positive directed node) would have the edge on its coboundary, see ISO 19107 Figure 35.
