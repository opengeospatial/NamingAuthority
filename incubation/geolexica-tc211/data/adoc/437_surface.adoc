=== surface

2-dimensional geometric primitive, locally representing a continuous image of a region of a plane

NOTE: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate the limits of the surface. Surfaces that are isomorphic to a sphere, or to an <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mi>n</mi>  </mstyle></math>-torus (a topological sphere with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mi>n</mi>  </mstyle></math> "handles") have no boundary. Such surfaces are called cycles.
