=== measurement precision

closeness of agreement between indications or measured quantity values obtained by replicate measurements on the same or similar objects under specified conditions

NOTE: Measurement precision is usually expressed numerically by measures of imprecision, such as standard deviation, variance, or coefficient of variation under the specified conditions of measurement.

NOTE: The "specified conditions" can be, for example, repeatability conditions of measurement, intermediate precision conditions of measurement, or reproducibility conditions of measurement (see ISO 5725-3).

NOTE: Measurement precision is used to define measurement repeatability, intermediate measurement precision, and measurement reproducibility.

NOTE: Sometimes "measurement precision" is erroneously used to mean measurement accuracy.
