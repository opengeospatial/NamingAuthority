=== subcomplex

complex all of whose elements are also in a larger complex

NOTE: Since the definitions of geometric complex and topological complex require only that they be closed under boundary operations, the set of any primitives of a particular dimension and below is always a subcomplex of the original, larger complex. Thus, any full planar topological complex contains an edge-node graph as a subcomplex.
