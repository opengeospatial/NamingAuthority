=== service delivery

interaction between a provider and a client where the provider offers a service

NOTE: Good service delivery provides clients with an increase in value. The provision of sufficient, affordable and quality basic services is considered a core function of governments. Service delivery, e.g. water, sanitation, waste management and housing, correlates closely with the health and well-being of citizens.
