=== main-road rule

set of criteria used at a turn in lieu of a route instruction; default instruction used at a node

NOTE: This rule represents what is "most natural" to do at a node (intersection), given the entry link used. The most common version is "as straight as possible", or to exit a turn on the most obvious extension of the entry street, which is usually, but not always, the same named street that was the entry. Every node in a route is either associated with an instruction or can be navigated by the main-road rule.
