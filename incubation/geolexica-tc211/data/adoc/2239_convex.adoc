=== convex <geometry>

containing all points on a "line" joining two interior points

NOTE: The definition of convex requires a definition of line. For coordinate systems, this is the usual linear interpolated arc, but in context, the "line" on a geometric reference surface will be a "geodesic arc". The default in this document is the linear interpolate.
