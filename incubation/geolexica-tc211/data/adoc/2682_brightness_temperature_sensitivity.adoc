=== brightness temperature sensitivity

minimum detectable change of the brightness temperature incident at the antenna-collecting aperture

NOTE: For the purpose of this document, the noise equivalent delta temperature (NEDT) values shall be defined as the standard deviation of the radiometer output in K when the antenna is viewing a 300 K uniform and stable target. For microwave radiometer, this is also called radiometric resolution.

NOTE: The formula relative to sensitivity is shown in D.2.
