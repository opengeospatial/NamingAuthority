=== gyroscope

device consisting of a spinning rotor mounted in a gimbal so that its axis of rotation maintains a fixed orientation

NOTE: The rotor spins on a fixed axis while the structure around it rotates or tilts. In airplanes, the pitch and orientation of the airplane is measured against the steady spin of the gyroscope. In space, where the four compass points are meaningless, the gyroscope's axis of rotation is used as a reference point for navigation. An inertial navigation system includes three gimbal-mounted gyroscopes, used to measure roll, pitch, and yaw.
