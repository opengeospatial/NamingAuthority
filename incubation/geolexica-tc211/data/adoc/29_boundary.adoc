=== boundary

set that represents the limit of an entity

NOTE: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that represent those points. In other arenas, the term is used metaphorically to describe the transition between an entity and the rest of its domain of discourse.
