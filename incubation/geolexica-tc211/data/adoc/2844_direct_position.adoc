=== direct position <coverage>

position inside one of the geometric objects in a coverage described by a coordinate tuple within the coverage coordinate reference system

NOTE: A direct position is described by an ordered sequence of coordinates. The number of elements in a direct position is established by the number of axes of the coverage CRS.

NOTE: This is consistent with the definition in ISO 19136-1:2020, 3.1.20.
