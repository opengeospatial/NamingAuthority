=== ground range <SAR>

magnitude of the range vector projected onto the ground

NOTE: Ground range of an image is represented by the distance from the nadir point of the antenna to a point in the scene. Usually measured in the horizontal plane, but can also be measured as true distance along the ground, DEM, geoid or ellipsoid surface.
