=== infringement (of a right)

prevention of an act of a principal consistent with rights granted to that principal on a resource

NOTE: Infringement of a right is a fault in the DRM system. If rights can be infringed without bypassing the DRM system, then the system is not properly restricted to that which is necessary.
