=== digital licence

document or its representation that specifies the rights granted to a particular user or organization with respect to a specific content or group of content

NOTE: The core concept in DRM is the use of digital licences. Instead of buying the digital content, the consumer purchases a licence granting certain rights with respect to the content. A licence is the mechanism by which a rights holder conveys rights to another party, such as a consumer or distributor.
