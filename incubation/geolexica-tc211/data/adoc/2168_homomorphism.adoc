=== homomorphism <mathematics>

relationship between two domains such that there is a structure-preserving function from one to the other

NOTE: A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function is required. In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms because they preserve "topological characteristics". The mapping of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
