=== projected coordinate reference system

coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference system by applying a map projection

NOTE: May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of the geographic coordinate reference system from which it is derived.

NOTE: In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic latitude and geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and easting and the ellipsoidal height is unchanged.
