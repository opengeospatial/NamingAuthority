=== dynamic coordinate reference system

coordinate reference system that has a dynamic reference frame

NOTE: Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time, usually due to crustal deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment.

NOTE: Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system should include coordinate epoch information.
