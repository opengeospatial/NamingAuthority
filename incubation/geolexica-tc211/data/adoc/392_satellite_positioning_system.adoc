=== satellite positioning system

positioning system based upon receipt of signals broadcast from satellites

NOTE: In this context, satellite positioning implies the use of radio signals transmitted from "active" artificial objects orbiting the Earth and received by "passive" instruments on or near the Earth's surface to determine position, velocity, and/or attitude of an object.  Examples are GPS and GLONASS.
