=== performance indicator

internal parameters of positioning systems indicative of the level of performance achieved

NOTE: Performance indicators can be used as quality-control evidence of the positioning system and/or positioning solution. Internal quality control may include such factors as signal strength of received radio signals [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)], figures indicating the dilution of precision (DOP) due to geometric constraints in radiolocation systems, and system-specific figure of merit (FOM).
