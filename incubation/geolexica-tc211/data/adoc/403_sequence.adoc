=== sequence

finite, ordered collection of related items (objects or values) that may be repeated

NOTE: Logically, a sequence is a set of pairs <item, offset>. LISP syntax, which delimits sequences with parentheses and separates elements in the sequence with commas, is used in this International Standard.
