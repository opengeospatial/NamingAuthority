=== bypass

mechanism to defeat the purpose of a subsystem by avoiding its invocation

NOTE: Security systems are bypassed usually by using security faults in the operating system. Such infringements are more an aspect of the operating system than of the security system. To correct this, the relationship between the security system and the operating system shall be modified to prevent bypass mechanisms.
