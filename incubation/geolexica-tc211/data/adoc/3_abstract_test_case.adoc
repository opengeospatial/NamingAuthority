=== abstract test case

generalized test for a particular requirement

NOTE: An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases One or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case. An abstract test case is independent of both the implementation and the values. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e. sequence of test events).
