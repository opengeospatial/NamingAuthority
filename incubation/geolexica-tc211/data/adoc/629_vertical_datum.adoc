=== vertical datum

datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths to the Earth

NOTE: In most cases, the vertical datum will be related to mean sea level. Ellipsoidal heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate system referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths.
