=== base representation <moving features>

representation, using a local origin and local ordinate vectors, of a geometric object at a given reference time

NOTE: A rigid geometric object may undergo translation or rotation, but remains congruent with its base representation.

NOTE: The local origin and ordinate vectors establish an engineering coordinate reference system (ISO 19111), also called a local frame or a local Euclidean coordinate system.
