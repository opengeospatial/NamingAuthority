photon counting mode for LIDAR systems, where the detector is biased and becomes sensitive to individual photons

NOTE: These detectors exist in the form of arrays and are bonded with electronic circuitry.  The electronic circuitry produces a measurement corresponding to the time at which the current was generated; resulting in a direct time-of-flight measurement.  A LIDAR that employs this detector technology typically illuminates a large scene with a single pulse.  The direct time-of-flight measurements are then combined with platform location/attitude data along with pointing information to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.  Additional processing is applied which removes existing noise present in the data to produce a visually exploitable data set.
