=== digital migration

transfer of digital information, while intending to preserve it, within the OAIS

NOTE: Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three attributes:  — a focus on the preservation of the full information content that needs preservation; —  a perspective that the new archival implementation of the information is a replacement for the old; —  an understanding that full control and responsibility over all aspects of the transfer resides with the OAIS.
