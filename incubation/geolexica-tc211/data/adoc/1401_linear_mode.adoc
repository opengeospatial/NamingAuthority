=== linear mode

LIDAR system in which output photocurrent is proportional to the input optical incident intensity

NOTE: A LIDAR system which employs this technology typically uses processing techniques to develop the time-of-flight measurements from the full waveform that is reflected from the targets in the illuminated scene of interest. These time-of-flight measurements are then combined with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing data to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
