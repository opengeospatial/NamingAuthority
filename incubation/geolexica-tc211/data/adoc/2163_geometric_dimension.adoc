=== geometric dimension <geometry, topology>

largest number n such that each point in a set of points can be associated with a subset that has that point in its interior and is topologically isomorphic to ùîºn, Euclidean n-space

NOTE: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line, have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <msup>      <mstyle mathvariant="double-struck">        <mi>R</mi>      </mstyle>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math> in their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood can be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <msup>      <mstyle mathvariant="double-struck">        <mi>R</mi>      </mstyle>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math>, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this document, most surfaces (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <msup>      <mstyle mathvariant="double-struck">        <mi>R</mi>      </mstyle>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math> by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
