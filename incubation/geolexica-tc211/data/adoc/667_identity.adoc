=== identity

data sufficient to identify an object over time, independent of its state

NOTE: An identity is usually a persistent and constant key member attribute value of the object. Since it is temporally constant and unique, it will be the same in any state associated to the object regardless of its timestamp. A moving object's identity is independent of both time and location.
