=== Place Identifier (PI) link

relationship established between PIs and other identifiers in different encoding domains

NOTE: While the identifiers of these features or objects can sometimes identify a place, within the scope of this document, the identifiers of features or objects existing in other encoding domains are referred to conceptually as "other identifiers".

NOTE: These "other identifiers" can exist outside of the PI architecture.
