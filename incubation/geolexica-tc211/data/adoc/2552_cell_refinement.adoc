=== cell refinement<DGGS>

process of subdividing parent cells into descendant child cells using a specified refinement ratio and suite of refinement strategies

NOTE: Iterative application of cell refinements creates a hierarchy of descendant discrete global grids.

NOTE: Cell refinement methods may result in child cells that each have a single parent or that have multiple parents.
