=== continuous coverage

coverage that returns different values for the same feature attribute at different direct positions within a single spatial object, temporal object, or spatiotemporal object in its domain

NOTE: Although the domain of a continuous coverage is ordinarily bounded in terms of its spatial and/or temporal extent, it can be subdivided into an infinite number of direct positions.
