=== traversable

condition of a link or turn that allows or restricts all traffic's traversal, as opposed to a more detailed navigation constraint

NOTE: Traversability is usually a function of physical, cultural, or legal conditions. If traversable is false, then the object cannot be navigated. This effectively removes a link from the usable network. In the case of a node, it effectively removes the node and all associated links from the useable network. In the case of a turn, it simply removes it from any viable route.  Non-traversable entities are not included in maneuvers or routes.
