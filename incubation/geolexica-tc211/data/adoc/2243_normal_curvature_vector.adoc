=== normal curvature vector <differential geometry, geodesy>

projection of the curvature vector of the curve perpendicular to the tangent plane to the surface at the point

NOTE: The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve and the surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature vector of a curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector of the surface. If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature vector of the curve everywhere, then the curve is a geodesic.
