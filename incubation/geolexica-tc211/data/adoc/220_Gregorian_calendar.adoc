=== Gregorian calendar

calendar in general use; first introduced in 1582 to define a year that more closely approximated the tropical year than the Julian calendar

NOTE: The introduction of the Gregorian calendar included the cancellation of the accumulated inaccuracies of the Julian year. In the Gregorian calendar, a calendar year is either a common year or a leap year; each year is divided into 12 sequential months.
