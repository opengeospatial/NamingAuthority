=== geometric realization <geometry, topology>

geometric complex where the geometric primitives are in a 1-to-1 correspondence to the topological primitives of a topological complex, such that the boundary relations in the two complexes agree

NOTE: In such a realization, the topological primitives are considered to represent the interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives even though the primitives themselves are closed.
