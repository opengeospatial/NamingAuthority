=== cycle <geometry, topology>

bounded spatial object with an empty boundary

NOTE: Cycles are used to describe boundary components. A cycle usually has no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not have infinite extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary (i.e., its boundary is empty), but is bounded.
