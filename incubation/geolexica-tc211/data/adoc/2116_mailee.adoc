=== mailee

party designated in a postal address as having responsibility for ensuring that postal items reach their addressee

NOTE: Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a postal address, i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then there is no mailee.

NOTE: Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly by use of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role descriptor.

NOTE: As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address might be ambiguous.
