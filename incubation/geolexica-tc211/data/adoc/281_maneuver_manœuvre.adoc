=== maneuver,man≈ìuvre

collection of related links and turns used in a route in combination

NOTE: Maneuvers are used to cluster turns into convenient and legal combinations. They may be as simple as a single turn, a combination of quick turns ("jogs" in the American mid-west consisting of a turn followed immediately by a turn in the opposite direction) or very complex combinations consisting of entry, exit, and connecting roadways  ("magic roundabouts" in the UK).
