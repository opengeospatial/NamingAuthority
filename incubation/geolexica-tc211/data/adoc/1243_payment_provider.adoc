=== payment provider

party that has an established billing relation with a consumer

NOTE: Payment providers can be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit card corporations, ISPs, network operators, and utility companies. The payment provider bills the consumer, deducts a fee, and forwards the payment to the content provider. The payment provider is thus responsible for the balancing of accounts.
