=== bearing

horizontal angle at a point relative to a specified direction

NOTE: The direction is usually specified to be north. In some communities the term bearing refers specifically to grid north and directions relative to true north are then termed ‘azimuth’; in other communities a bearing refers specifically to true north. In this International Standard bearing is used for any specified reference direction. The angle may be reckoned positive clockwise or positive counter-clockwise depending upon the application.
