=== stereotype <UML>

new type of modeling element that extends the semantics of the metamodel

NOTE: Stereotypes must be based on certain existing types or classes in the metamodel. Stereotypes may extend the semantics, but not the structure of pre-existing types and classes. Certain stereotypes are predefined in the UML, others may be user defined. Stereotypes are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. The others are constraint and tagged value.
