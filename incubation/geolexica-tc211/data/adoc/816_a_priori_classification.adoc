=== a priori classification

classification scheme structured so that the classes are abstract conceptualizations of the types actually occurring

NOTE: Taken from FAO LCCS version 2 (see Reference [2] in ISO 19144-1)

NOTE: The approach is based upon definition of classes before any data collection actually takes place

NOTE: See Annex B [of ISO 19144-1] for an examination of this and a posteriori classification
