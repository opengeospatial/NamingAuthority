=== basic service

service providing a basic function to other services or applications in a functional manner

NOTE: cf. interoperate. Basic services lack any persistent, user-specific state information between invocations and are not meant for direct access by users. Because they act in a functional manner, they are readily replaceable at runtime by other services using the same interfaces.
