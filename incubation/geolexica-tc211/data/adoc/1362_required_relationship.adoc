=== required relationship

explicit association between either spatial units, or between basic administrative units

NOTE: Due to legal aspects, history of data, inaccurate geometries or missing geometries, geospatial overlay techniques may generate invalid, or no relationships between spatial units, which can be introduced by required relationships.

NOTE: Relationships for spatial units may be defined with ISO 19125-2 types.
