=== accessibility

ability to access and benefit from the functionality provided by a service or a facility

NOTE: Accessibility is often associated with disabilities. According to the concept of universal design, accessibility is, however, a matter that permanently or temporarily is relevant to all of us, e.g. people with heavy luggage, people with broken legs, people with small children, elderly people, etc.
