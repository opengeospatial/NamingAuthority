=== duration

non-negative quantity of time equal to the difference between the final and initial instants of a time interval

NOTE: The duration is one of the base quantities in the International System of Quantities (ISQ) on which the International System of Units (SI) is based. The term "time" instead of "duration" is often used in this context and also for an infinitesimal duration.

NOTE: For the term "duration", expressions such as "time" or "time interval" are often used, but the term "time" is not recommended in this sense and the term "time interval" is deprecated in this sense to avoid confusion with the concept of "time interval".

NOTE: The exact duration of a time scale unit depends on the time scale used. For example, the durations of a year, month, week, day, hour or minute, may depend on when they occur [in a Gregorian calendar, a calendar month can have a duration of 28, 29, 30, or 31 days; in a 24-hour clock, a clock minute can have a duration of 59, 60, or 61 seconds, etc.]. Therefore, the exact duration can only be evaluated if the exact duration of each is known.

NOTE: This definition is closely related to NOTE 1 of the terminological entry "duration" in IEC 60050-113:2011, 113"“01"“13.
