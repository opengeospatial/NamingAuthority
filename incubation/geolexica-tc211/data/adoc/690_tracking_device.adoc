=== tracking device

device (tag) carried by a vehicle to allow it to determine its location or to be sensed by external objects of known location

NOTE: The most common tracking devices are cell phones, GNSS chips, RFID (Radio Frequency ID) tags, or printed tags which are scanable by optical sensors  such as "bar codes".

NOTE: The common usage of  "vehicle" means a "form of conveyance" or, more simply "thing that conveys (carries) something else".  Thus, a tracked object that carries a tracking device to allow it to be tracked is, by definition, a conveyance or vehicle for that device.  Thus, a cell phone that carries a GNSS device is the vehicle for that device, and the traveller carrying the cell phone, allowing him to be tracked, is the vehicle for the phone and all of its internal electronics.
