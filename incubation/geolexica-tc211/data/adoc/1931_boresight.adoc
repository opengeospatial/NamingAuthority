=== boresight

calibration of a lidar sensor system, equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), to accurately determine or establish its position and orientation

NOTE: The position of the lidar sensor system (x, y, z) is determined with respect to the GNSS antenna. The orientation (roll, pitch, heading) of the lidar sensor system is determined with respect to straight and level flight.
