=== spherical coordinate system

two- or three-dimensional coordinate system in Euclidean space in which position is specified by two angular coordinates and (in the three-dimensional case) one distance coordinate

NOTE: Not to be confused with an ellipsoidal coordinate system based on an ellipsoid 'degenerated' into a sphere.
