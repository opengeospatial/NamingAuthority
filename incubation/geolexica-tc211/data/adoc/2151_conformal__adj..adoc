=== conformal, adj.

angle-preserving

NOTE: Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the angle between curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane cross at a 90°, then the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at 90°, such as lines of constant latitude and lines of constant longitude.
