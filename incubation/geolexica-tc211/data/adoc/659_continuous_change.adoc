=== continuous change

change in an attribute whose type has a distance measure such that its value can be assumed to take on intermediate values between two known measurements

NOTE: The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into consideration constraints on the "curve" joining the two data points (time1, value1) and (time2, value2), looking at the value as a function of time. For example, if the continuous change is for the motion of a vehicle, then the constraints of physics and of the paths appropriate for that vehicle must be taken into consideration.
