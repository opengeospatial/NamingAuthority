=== fiducial mark

index marks, typically four or eight rigidly connected with the camera body, which form images on the film negative and define the image coordinate reference system

NOTE: When a camera is calibrated the distances between fiducial marks are precisely measured and assigned coordinates that assist in correcting for film distortion.
