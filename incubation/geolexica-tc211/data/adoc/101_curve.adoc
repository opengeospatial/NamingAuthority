=== curve

1-dimensional geometric primitive, representing the continuous image of a line

NOTE: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is called the start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the "continuous image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states that a continuous image of a connected set is connected.
