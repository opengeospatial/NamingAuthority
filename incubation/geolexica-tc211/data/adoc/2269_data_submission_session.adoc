=== data submission session

delivery of media or a single telecommunications session that provides data to an OAIS

NOTE: The data submission session format/contents is based on a data model negotiated between the OAIS and the producer in the submission agreement. This data model identifies the logical constructs used by the producer and how they are represented on each media delivery or in the telecommunication session.
