=== path connected

property of a geometric object implying that any two points on the object can be placed on a curve that remains totally within the object

NOTE: There are more general geometries that are connected but not path connected, but they are not representable as collections of  "digital" geometries defined in this document. No geometric objects constructible by the methods in this document on a standard digital computer can be connected but not path connected. See the notes at the term "connected"
