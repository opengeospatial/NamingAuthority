=== spatial unit

single area (or multiple areas) of land and/or water, or a single volume (or multiple volumes) of space

NOTE: A single area is the norm and multiple areas are the exception.

NOTE: Spatial units are structured in a way to support the creation and management of basic administrative units.

NOTE: This International Standard [ISO 19152:2012] supports either 2-dimensional (2D), 3-dimensional (3D), or mixed (2D and 3D) representations of spatial units, which may be described in text (“from this tree to that river”), or based on a single point, or represented as a set of unstructured lines, or as a surface, or as a 3D volume.

NOTE: In addition to spatial units represented by a single point, text, or a set of unstructured lines, a spatial unit may have an area equal to zero for administrative reasons.
