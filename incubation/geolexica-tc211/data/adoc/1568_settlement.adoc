=== settlement

general lowering in level of a moving vessel, relative to what its level would be were it motionless, due to the regional depression of the surface of the water in which the ship moves

NOTE: Settlement is not an increase in displacement.

NOTE: Settlement is measured as an angular tilt about the centre of gravity of the vessel.
