=== transport mode

means that travellers can choose for transport

NOTE: In this International Standard, the term ”transport mode” is frequently shortened to “mode” for convenience. Transport mode is usually covering groups of vehicles, e.g. transport means used for road transport, rail transport, sea transport, air transport and cable transport. A mode for inland water-borne transport is also added.
