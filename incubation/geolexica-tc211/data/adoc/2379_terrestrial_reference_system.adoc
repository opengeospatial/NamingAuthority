=== terrestrial reference system

set of conventions defining the origin, scale, orientation and time evolution of a spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its diurnal motion in space

NOTE: The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference frame that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely determined coordinates and optionally their rates of change. In this document terrestrial reference frame is included within the geodetic reference frame element of the data model.
