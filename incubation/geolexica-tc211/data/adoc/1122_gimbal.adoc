=== gimbal

mechanical device consisting of two or more rings connected in such a way that each rotates freely around an axis that is a diameter of the next ring toward the outermost ring of the set

NOTE: An object mounted on a three-ring gimbal will remain horizontally suspended on a plane between the rings regardless as to the stability of the base.
