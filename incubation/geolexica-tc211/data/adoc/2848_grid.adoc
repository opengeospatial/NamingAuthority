=== grid <coverage>

covering of a multi-dimensional region using quadrilateral shapes (in the 2D case) or their n-dimensional generation (in the nD case) with no overlaps and gaps

NOTE: The term "grid" originates historically from a 2D view: in ISO 19123 a grid consists of a network composed of one or more sets of curves in which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets. Meantime, nD grids (including 1D) are known and in use. The "covering" of a region is also known as a "tessellation" in mathematics.

NOTE: The ISO 19123 definition is equivalent to the revised definition of this document.
