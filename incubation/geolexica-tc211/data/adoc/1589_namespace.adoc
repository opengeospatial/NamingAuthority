=== namespace <RDF>

common URI prefix or stem used in identifiers for a set of related resources

NOTE: The RDF namespace is concatenated with the localName to create the complete URI identifier for an RDF resource. Every RDF resource is identified by a URI. In contrast, an XML namespace URI scopes a local XML component name, but there is no rule for combining these into a single identifier string.
