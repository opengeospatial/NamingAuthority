=== boundary face

face that is used in the 3-dimensional representation of a boundary of a spatial unit

NOTE: Boundary faces are used when the implied vertical and unbounded faces of a boundary face string are not sufficient to describe 3D spatial units. Boundary faces close volumes in height (e.g. every apartment floor), or in depth (e.g. an underground parking garage), or in all other directions to form a bounded volume. The volumes represent legal space (in contrast with physical space).
