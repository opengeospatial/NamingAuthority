=== fair use

uses of content that are considered valid defences to copyright infringement, such as for criticism or educational purposes

NOTE: Fair use is based on case-law precedents derived from general principles. The term is often misapplied to refer to the reasonable expectations of consumers to be able to use purchased content on all owned devices.
