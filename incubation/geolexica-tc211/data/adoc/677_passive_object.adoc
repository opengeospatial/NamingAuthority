=== passive object

object which can only react to external stimulation and cannot initiate actions on its own

NOTE: A passive object is usually accessed through an external interface, through which it receives requests, processes those requests and returns data as a response to that request. Since objects can implement more than one type, it is possible for a single object to pass through active and passive states. For example, a tracking service can lie dormant until a tracking request activates a period where the internals of the object initiate tracking activities based on internal triggers as specified within the request. When the tracking request is deactivated, the object may return to a passive state.
