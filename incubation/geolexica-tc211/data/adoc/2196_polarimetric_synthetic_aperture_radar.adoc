SAR sensor enhanced by transmitting and receiving in different combinations of polarization

NOTE: By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize the target more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives orthogonal (e.g. horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates four polarizations of a single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol SAR is addressed in this document.
