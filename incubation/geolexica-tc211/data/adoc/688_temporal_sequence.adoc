=== temporal sequence

ordered sequence of timestamps associated to a sequence of representations of the same object

NOTE: Temporal sequences are not assumed to be evenly spaced in time, nor equidistance in space. For discrete change, the default logic is to sample at temporal points of change if possible, so that the timestamp is the first temporal instance where the attributes listed have taken on that combination of values. For sake of space savings, some samples in a sequence only list those values that have changed since the immediately preceding temporal sample. For this reason, a sample should only be considered in the context of its containing sequence. For rigid motions (such as vehicle tracking), only centroid (a point value) and orientation (direction of travel) are needed for a temporal sequence describing location and spatial extent. A motion in combination with an object deformation would require more information.
