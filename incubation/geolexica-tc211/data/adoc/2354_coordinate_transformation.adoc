=== coordinate transformation

coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system in which the source and target coordinate reference systems are based on different datums

NOTE: A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically. Any error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate transformation and when the coordinate transformation is applied the embedded errors are transmitted to output coordinates.

NOTE: A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as a 'datum transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation changes coordinate values. It does not change the definition of the datum. In this document coordinates are referenced to a coordinate reference system. A coordinate transformation operates between two coordinate reference systems, not between two datums.
