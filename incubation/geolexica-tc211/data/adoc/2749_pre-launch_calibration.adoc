=== pre-launch calibration

sequence of measurement and characterization that takes place during and after instrument assembly and integration, prior to launch

NOTE: Pre-launch calibration provides the best or only chance to measure calibration key data (CKD) such as spectral response, linearity and polarization sensitivity, and also provides an important quality control and validation function to prevent unpleasant surprises and disappointment after launch.

NOTE: Pre-launch calibration is also called ground calibration.
