=== refinement ratio <DGGS>

ratio of the number of child cells to parent cells

NOTE: A positive integer ratio <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mi>n</mi>  </mstyle></math> refinement of DGGS parent cells yield n times as many child cells as parent cells.

NOTE: For a two-dimensional DGGS (as defined for EAERS in this document) this is the surface area ratio.

NOTE: In DGGS literature [34] the term aperture has been used instead of refinement ratio. Refinement ratio is preferred because it is clearer in meaning to audiences outside the early DGGS community.
