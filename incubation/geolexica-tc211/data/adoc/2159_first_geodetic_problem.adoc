=== first geodetic problem <differential geometry, geodesy>

problem that given a point on a surface and the direction and distance from that point to a second point along a geodesic, determines that second point

NOTE: This "problem" defines a mapping from the vector space at a point (each vector given by a direction and a length) to points of the Figure of Earth that satisfy the problem for that direction and distance. For example, if we fix the distance "<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mi>r</mi>  </mstyle></math>" and take all directions, the resultant geometry is the circle centred at the original point of radius "<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mi>r</mi>  </mstyle></math>". This document will make heavy use of this mapping; see exponential map and the second geodetic problem.
