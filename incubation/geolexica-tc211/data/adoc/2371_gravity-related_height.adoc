=== gravity-related height

height that is dependent on the Earthâ€™s gravity field

NOTE: This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height, which are both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean sea level, but also may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights or geopotential numbers.

NOTE: The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
