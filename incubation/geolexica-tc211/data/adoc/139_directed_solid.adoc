=== directed solid

directed topological object that represents an association between a topological solid and one of its orientations

NOTE: Directed solids are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial association between face and topological solid. The orientation of a solid is with respect to a face, "+" if the upNormal is outward, "-" if inward. This is consistent with the concept of "up = outward" for a surface bounding a solid.
