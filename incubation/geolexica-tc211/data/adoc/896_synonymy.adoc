=== synonymy

relation between or among terms in a given language representing the same concept

NOTE: The relation of synonymy exists, for example, between deuterium and heavy hydrogen.

NOTE: Terms which are interchangeable in all contexts are called synonyms; if they are interchangeable only in some contexts, they are called quasi-synonyms.
