=== thematic data

gridded data whose attribute values describe characteristics of a grid coverage feature in a grid format

NOTE: Most gridded thematic data are derived from imagery (4.12) data using geophysical/atmospheric inversion algorithms. Gridded thematic data may also be obtained from other sources such as digitization of topographic map sheets.
