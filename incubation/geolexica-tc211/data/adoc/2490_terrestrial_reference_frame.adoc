=== terrestrial reference frame

realization of a terrestrial reference system (TRS), by specifying its origin, orientation, scale, and its time evolution

NOTE: The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with precisely determined coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which may include the rate of coordinate change.

NOTE: The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are defined, and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without considering the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization may be called dynamic when these external forces are considered. "Dynamic" is also used colloquially to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases without distinction.
