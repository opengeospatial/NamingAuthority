=== object

entity with a well defined boundary and identity that encapsulates state and behaviour

NOTE: This term was first used in this way in the general theory of object oriented programming, and later adopted for use in this same sense in UML. An object is an instance of a class. Attributes and relationships represent state. Operations, methods, and state machines represent behavior.
