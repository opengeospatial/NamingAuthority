=== geometric dimension

largest number n such that each direct position in a geometric set can be associated with a subset that has the direct position in its interior and is similar (isomorphic) to Rn, Euclidean n-space

NOTE: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line, have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot be mapped to <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mo></mo>    <msup>      <mtext>R</mtext>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math> in their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighbourhood can be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mo></mo>    <msup>      <mtext>R</mtext>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math>, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this International Standard, most surface patches (instances of GM_SurfacePatch) are mapped to portions of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">  <mstyle displaystyle="true">    <mo></mo>    <msup>      <mtext>R</mtext>      <mn>2</mn>    </msup>  </mstyle></math> by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
