=== spatial dimension, adj <topology, geometry>

number of independent decisions in a coordinate system required to locate a position

NOTE: This definition is logically equivalent to the topological dimension of spatial projection of the CRS. It describes the space as a target for geometry. Grammatically, the term can be a noun but used to describe space, as "the spatial dimension of CRS84 is 2".
