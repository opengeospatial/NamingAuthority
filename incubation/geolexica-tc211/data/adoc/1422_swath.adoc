=== swath <LIDAR>

ground area from which return data are collected during continuous airborne LIDAR operation

NOTE: A typical mapping mission may consist of multiple adjacent swaths, with some overlap, and the operator will turn off the laser while the aircraft is oriented for the next swath.  This term may also be referred to as a Pass.
