=== cell <DGGS>

spatial, spatio-temporal or temporal unit of geometry with dimensionality greater than 0, associated with a zone

NOTE: All cells within a DGGS share the dimensionality of the DGGS's parent global geometry. DGGSs with dimensionality of 0 are not supported.

NOTE: Cells are the unit of geometry in a DGGS, and the geometry of the region of space-time occupied by a zone is a cell.

NOTE: While the terms cell and zone are often used interchangeably, "zone" is the strictly preferred term. Cell is entirely appropriate when specifically discussing a zone's geometry or topology.
