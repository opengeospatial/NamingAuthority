=== homomorphism

relationship between two domains (such as two complexes) such that there is a structure preserving function from one to the other

NOTE: Homomorphisms are distinct from isomorphisms in that no inverse function is required. In an isomorphism, there are essentially two homomorphisms that are functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms because they preserve "topological characteristics." The mapping of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
