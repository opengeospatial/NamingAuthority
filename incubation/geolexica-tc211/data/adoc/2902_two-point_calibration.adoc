=== two-point calibration

adjustment of the relationship between the input signal and the output response of a radiometer using two distinct input stimuli

NOTE: Assuming a linear receiver, all possible input signal levels can now be retrieved from the radiometer output responses.

NOTE: In the case of an external end-to-end calibration, the input signal equals the antenna temperature of the radiometer.
