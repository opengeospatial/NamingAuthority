=== intensity

power per unit solid angle from a point source into a particular direction

NOTE: Typically for LIDAR, sufficient calibration has not been done to calculate absolute intensity, so relative intensity is usually reported.  In linear mode systems, this value is typically provided as an integer, resulting from a mapping of the returnâ€™s signal power to an integer value via a lookup table.
