=== cross-talk

any signal or circuit unintentionally affecting another signal or circuit

NOTE: For PolSAR sensor, if the transmitting channel is horizontally (H) polarized, the cross-talk on transmitting defines the ratio of V polarization transmitting power to H polarization transmitting power, expressed in decibels (dB). The cross-talk on receiving is similar to that on transmitting.
