=== tagged value <UML>

explicit definition of a property as a name-value pair

NOTE: In a tagged value, the name is referred as the tag. Certain tags are predefined in the UML; others may be user defined. Tagged values are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML. The others are constraint and stereotype.
