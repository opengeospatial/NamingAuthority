=== universal face

unbounded face in a 2-dimensional complex

NOTE: The universal face is normally not part of any feature, and is used to represent the unbounded portion of the data set. Its interior boundary (it has no exterior boundary) would normally be considered the exterior boundary of the map represented by the data set. This International Standard does not special case the universal face, but application schemas may find it convenient to do so.
