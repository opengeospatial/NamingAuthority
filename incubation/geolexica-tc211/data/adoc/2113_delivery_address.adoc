=== delivery address <postal>

postal address which the postal operator is requested to use to deliver the postal item

NOTE: In the normal case, the delivery address is the same as the postal address specified by the mailer.

NOTE: The delivery address may in certain circumstances, e.g. unaddressed mail, not actually be represented on the postal item. In this case, the delivery address is determined by the postal operator in accordance with an agreement between the operator and the mailer.

NOTE: The postal item might not actually be delivered to the requested delivery address. For example, in the case of forwarding, delivery takes place at the forwarding address.
