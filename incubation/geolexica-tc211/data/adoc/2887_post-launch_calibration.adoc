=== post-launch calibration

all calibration activities that occur after a satellite-based Earth observation (EO) sensor is on-orbit

NOTE: The post-launch calibration may also be referred to as on-orbit calibration.

NOTE: The scope of the post-launch calibration varies from program to program and sensor to sensor, and includes considerations such as mission objectives, measurement requirements, mission operations capabilities, sensor data collection capabilities, and the ability to downlink low-level sensor response data to the ground.

NOTE: Post-launch calibration activities are included in the calibration plan and are executed according to the post-launch calibration procedures.
