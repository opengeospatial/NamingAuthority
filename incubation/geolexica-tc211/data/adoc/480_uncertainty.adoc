=== uncertainty

parameter, associated with the result of measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand

NOTE: When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as coordinates, is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter is an estimate of the uncertainty of the measurement results. Because accuracy is a qualitative concept, one should not use it quantitatively, that is associate numbers with it; numbers should be associated with measures of uncertainty instead.
