=== depth

distance of a point from a chosen vertical reference surface downward along a line that is perpendicular to that surface

NOTE: The line direction may be straight, or be dependent on the Earth's gravity field or other physical phenomena.

NOTE: A depth above the vertical reference surface will have a negative value.
