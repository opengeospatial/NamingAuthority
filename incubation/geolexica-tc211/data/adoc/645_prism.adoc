=== prism <one parameter set of geometries>

set of points in the union of the geometries (or the union of the trajectories) of a one parameter set of geometries

NOTE: This is a generalization of the concept of a geometric prism that is the convex hull of two congruent polygons in 3D-space. Such polyhedrons can be viewed as a foliation of congruent polygons.
