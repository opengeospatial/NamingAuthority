    skos:definition "The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, “versionable”, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.  A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time.  The application of CDB to future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration management timelines.  With the addition of the High Level Architecture - -Federation Object Model (HLA/FOM)  and DIS protocols, the application of the CDB standard provides a Common Environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common view of the simulated environment.  The CDB standard defines an open format for the storage, access and modification of a synthetic environment database.  A synthetic environment is a computer simulation that represents activities at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to factories and manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a single computer or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated . This standard defines the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a full-mission simulator.  The standard makes use of several commercial and simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry.  A series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for data representation of real world features." ;

However, the developers of GML envision communities working to define community-specific application schemas [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GML_Application_Schemas] that are specialized extensions of GML. Using application schemas, users can refer to roads, highways, and bridges instead of points, lines and polygons.

Feedback items can be aggregated in collections and summaries of the collections can also be described.

This selective use of ISO metadata elements prioritizes interoperability with developing ISO metadata models. The conceptual encoding is designed to be used combination with an encoding standard.

A ‘context document’ specifies a fully configured service set which can be exchanged (with a consistent interpretation) among clients supporting the standard. The OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context) was created to allow a set of configured information resources (service set) to be passed between applications primarily as a collection of services. OWS Context is developed to support in-line content as well. The goal is to support use cases such as the distribution of search results, the exchange of a set of resources such as OGC Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), Web Coverage Service (WCS) and others in a ‘common operating picture’. Additionally OWS Context can deliver a set of configured processing services (Web Processing Service (WPS)) parameters to allow the processing to be reproduced on different nodes." ;

The goal of the OWS Common Security Standard is to allow the implementation of IA controls and to advertise their existence in an interoperable way with minimal impact to existing implementations using a backwards-compatible approach. That goal is being pursued in two ways:  Identify and document IA Controls for supporting authentication in a register maintained through the OGC.  Specify how a service can advertise their IA controls through the Service Capabilities Document. This OGC standard applies to OWS deployed on HTTPS. It specifies how conformant OWS Services shall advertise their IA Controls and additional security features. The advertisement uses XML elements that are already part of the Capabilities document structure. This ensures that existing client implementations will not break.  The standard also describes the governance process for the IA Control registers, examples of register contents, and descriptions on how this information should be used.  Next, this standard defines conformance classes and requirements classes to be used for reaching compliance and their validation via conformance tests.  Finally, this standard defines client behavior to ensure interoperable processing of advertised security controls." ;

    skos:definition "This standard defines a protocol for RS232 and Ethernet connected instruments. PUCK addresses installation and configuration challenges for sensors by defining a standard instrument protocol to store and automatically retrieve metadata and other information from the instrument device itself.  Most sensor networks require careful manual installation and configuration by technicians to assure that software components are properly associated with the physical instruments that they represent. Instrument driver software, configuration files, and metadata describing the instrument and its capabilities must be manually installed and associated with a physical instrument port. Sometimes these manual procedures must be performed under physically challenging conditions, increasing the chances of human error. PUCK addresses these challenges by defining a standard instrument protocol to retrieve metadata and other information from the device itself. This information can include OGC SWE SensorML and IEEE 1451 Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) documents, as well as actual instrument driver code. Computers on the network can use the PUCK protocol to retrieve this information from installed instruments and utilize it appropriately, e.g. to automatically identify, configure and operate the instruments. Thus PUCK enables automatic self-configuring plug-and-work sensor networks.  The PUCK standard is relatively simple, and several manufacturers have already implemented the protocol in their instruments' firmware. PUCK augments but doesn't replace existing instrument command sets, so it can be implemented without abandoning existing firmware and software applications.  PUCK was originally developed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) for oceanographic applications, but is useful in any sensor network containing RS232 or Ethernet-connected instruments. PUCK-enabled instruments have been deployed on ocean observatories in the USA and Europe, and the protocol is being considered for adoption by other projects as well. With the approval by the OGC membership of the OGC PUCK Protocol Standard, and with the OGC Technical Committee's PUCK Standards Working Group in place to provide future support, the PUCK standard is expected to be adopted by an even wider sensor community." ;

This International Standard specifies discovery operations, query operations, locking operations, transaction operations and operations to manage stored, parameterized query expressions. Discovery operations allow the service to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and to retrieve the application schema that defines the feature types that the service offers. Query operations allow features or values of feature properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon constraints, defined by the client, on feature properties. Locking operations allow exclusive access to features for the purpose of modifying or deleting features. Transaction operations allow features to be created, changed, replaced and deleted from the underlying data store. Stored query operations allow clients to create, drop, list and described parameterized query expressions that are stored by the server and can be repeatedly invoked using different parameter values. This International Standard defines eleven operations: GetCapabilities (discovery operation), DescribeFeatureType (discovery operation), GetPropertyValue (query operation), GetFeature (query operation), GetFeatureWithLock (query and locking operation), LockFeature (locking operation), Transaction (transaction operation), CreateStoredQuery (stored query operation), DropStoredQuery (stored query operation), ListStoredQueries (stored query operation), DescribeStoredQueries (stored query operation).
