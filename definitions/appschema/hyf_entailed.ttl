A given catchment realization exists within a hydrologic complex in that, if a catchment realization exists, it exists in the same hydrologic complex as the catchment it realizes. In this way, any realization of a catchment has the same hydrologic determination of the catchment it realizes. If a catchment is connected with other catchments via inflow and/or outflow hydro nexuses, its realizations are also connected. A realization of the logical catchment is always of higher topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding hydro nexus topological boundary. For example, a linear flowpath realizing a catchment may be understood as an edge between inflow and outflow nodes; the areal realization of a catchment as a face bounded by linear inflow and outflow.

The catchment realization features defined in this standard refer to objects on the land surface for the purpose of surface water hydrology. In other contexts, other types of catchment realization may exist. Catchment realizations that do not conform to those defined in this standard, for instance realizations in 3- or 4-dimensional perspectives, may be implemented using the general HY_CatchmentRealization type.

  skos:definition """The HY_HydroLocation feature type (Figure 35) conceptualizes the idea that a hydro nexus can be realized by practically any feature of interest. The hydro nexus concept is used to define the hydrologic determination of a catchment but, like the catchment concept, does not have inherent realization(s). Any hydrologically significant feature that can be identified as (said to be) the outlet of a catchment may realize the hydro nexus. Typically, this will be a permanent, stable location that is fixed and/or referenced by coordinates. 

Landmarks such as confluences, points corresponding to vertical sections, or the position of a monitoring station on a river are typical realizations of the hydro nexus. Other kinds of hydro nexus realizations that don't carry normal surface water characteristics as defined in this standard, e.g. a spring where groundwater enters the surface, an arbitrary point projected onto the surface, or a nexus that collects many disjoint locations may use or specialize the general HY_HydroLocation type. 

Topologically, the HY_HydroLocation should be understood to be the boundary of the corresponding catchment, and always of lower topological dimension than the catchment. Even though the topological realization of a hydro nexus is typically as a node between catchment edges, a nexus realization may also have any geometric representation, including a single point.

In many cases, HY_HydroLocations are known but corresponding catchments and hydro nexuses are not defined. For example, stream gages that are part of a catchment dataset whose hydro nexus features are realized by confluences. Both the stream gages and confluences are HY_HydroLocations, but the stream gages’ hydro nexus features are not defined. Using this concept, HY_HydroLocation is expected to be used to link between datasets that have catchments delineated for different HY_HydroLocations.

HY_HydroLocation carries two attributes: <i>shape</i> and <i>hydroLocationType</i>. It has <i>referencedPosition</i> and <i>realizedNexus</i> associations implying the hydro-complex<i> </i>feature collection."""@en;

A catchment may receive flow from several upstream catchments or contribute flow to several downstream catchments through a single hydro nexus. Through shared identity, each hydro nexus feature may be associated with different realizations within a hydrologic complex given that each realization has the same hydrologic function or characteristics. This includes the topological realization as a node on the one-dimensional flowpath (edge) in terms of a topological 'boundary'. 

Placed topologically relative to a catchment which links inflow and outflow, a hydro nexus has a position relative to another hydro nexus that is 'fixed' in the network by the catchments it is associated with. Additionally, the union of catchment and hydro nexus(es) can be used to define a linear river reference system, where an inflow or outflow node is the origin and the flowpath realizing the catchment is the linear element along which a position can be determined."""@en;

The (indirect) position of an outflow node referenced along an upstream oriented flowpath can be expressed as the distance from an upstream inflow node located on that flowpath, while the (indirect) position of an inflow node referenced along a downstream oriented flowpath can be expressed as distance from a downstream outflow node located on the flowpath. An ‘intermediate’ position referencing known inflow and outflow nodes bounding a flowpath at both ends can be expressed as part of the distance along the entire flowpath, measured from the upstream end of an upstream flowpath, and/or from the downstream end of a downstream flowpath.
