=== Introduction

This annex includes useful information from the previous document OGC 07-092r3

=== URNs for Coordinate Reference Systems

One frequent use of URNs is referencing the CRS for an OGC Web Service input or output; another use is referencing the CRS for a feature geometry or a bounding box. These URNs are used to identify the referenced CRS, not to transfer a definition of that CRS. Most of this material is also applicable to referencing CRS components and Coordinate Operations and their components, often referred to as objects.

*NOTE 1:* Subclause D.14 of [OGC 06-121r3] summarizes many of the requirements considered when specifying how to reference CRSs.

Document [OGC 06-121r3] specifies that each specific OWS shall always reference a CRS by using an XML attribute or element with the type anyURI. Such an anyURI value can be used to reference a CRS whether the definition of that CRS is included in the same data transfer, is NOT included in the same data transfer, cannot be electronically accessed, or can be electronically accessed.

*NOTE 2:* In XML Schemas, the anyURI data type is the standard way to briefly reference (or cite) a value specified elsewhere. XML attributes with the type anyURI include the GML defined attributes named gml:srsName, gml:uom, xlink:href, and gml:codeSpace.

When using an XML attribute or element with the type anyURI to reference a CRS, CRS-related, or other object, that URI shall have a value which uses one of two alternative URI formats:

a) Uniform Resource Locator (URL), with standard form. The URL format should be used whenever the referenced definition is known to be electronically available using this standard URL.

b) Uniform Resource Name (URN), with a specified form. The URN format shall be used whenever the referenced definition is not, or might not be, available using a URL. This URN shall reference data that is specified by some 'authority' and is 'well-known' to both client and server software, including multiple clients and multiple servers.

*NOTE 3:* Two widely-used forms of URI are URL and URN. We are specifying using URNs as the way of citing CRS-related definitions that are "well-known" but are not adequately electronically available using a URL.

Subclause 10.3.2 of the OWS Common specification [OGC 06-121r3] specifies when and how to use URLs to reference a CRS or CRS-related object. Use of URNs is expected to be more common than use of URLs, and specific OWS Implementation Specifications are expected to use many standard URN values.

=== URNs and URLs

URNs [IETF RFC 2141] are a kind of URI [IETF RFC 2396], and may be used as the value of references where a URI is required. This is often the case in GML-based encodings (e.g., the standard XML attributes xlink:href, xlink:role, xlink:arcrole, srsName, uom, codeSpace) and in OGC Web Services (OWS) operation requests and responses.

A URN serves as a persistent identifier of a resource or concept. A detailed description of the resource may also be available online, with a resource locator (URL) providing an access point. In general, there is no direct mapping or algorithm to obtain a URL for the resource designated by a URN. URNs are intended to be more persistent than URLs, so that they remain valid even if a resource description is relocated. However, a resolution service or resolver is expected to provide a URL corresponding to a URN.

=== URN and schema component designators

In a few places in OWS interfaces, an identifier for an XML component is required. In these cases, it is important that the identifier reference the actual schema definition, which may then be used as the template for an OWS request or response.

A number of options are available for identification of schema components. The W3C XML Schema recommendation provides QName (qualified name â€“ see XML Schema Part 2, clause 3.2.18). A QName has the lexical form ns:name where 'ns' is an XML namespace prefix for which a namespace declaration is in scope. The QName thus corresponds with an identifier tuple {namespace, local name} where 'namespace' is the fully scoped identifier for the XML namespace. In contrast, a URN identifier is complete, and does not depend on context for resolution of the namespace prefix.

NOTE: The W3C XML activity is currently considering a more complete scheme for identification of schema components, documented in the working draft XML Schema: Component Designators http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-ref/.

In OWS interfaces, XML components are generally identified using a QName.

While there is some overlap of the meaning of schema component designators with the OGC URN scheme used for dataTypes and featureTypes, it should be understood that a URN identifies the concept, and not just its XML and XML Schema implementation. Of course, the concepts denoted by identifiers from the featureType branch generally have XML Schema implementations, so direct mappings are implied. Note that the mapping may be one-to-many, for example to manage versioning of the XML schema implementation independent of versioning of the concept.
