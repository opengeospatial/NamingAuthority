Introduction 

This part of OpenGIS® Simple Features Access (SFA), also called ISO 19125, describes the common 
architecture for simple feature geometry. The simple feature geometry object model is Distributed Computing 
Platform neutral and uses UML notation. The base Geometry class has subclasses for Point, Curve, Surface and 
GeometryCollection. Each geometric object is associated with a Spatial Reference System, which describes the 
coordinate space in which the geometric object is defined. 

The extended Geometry model has specialized 0, 1 and 2-dimensional collection classes named MultiPoint, 
MultiLineString and MultiPolygon for modelling geometries corresponding to collections of Points, LineStrings and 
Polygons, respectively. MultiCurve and MultiSurface are introduced as abstract superclasses that generalize the 
collection interfaces to handle Curves and Surfaces. 

The attributes, methods and assertions for each Geometry class are described in Figure 1 in 6.1.1. In describing 
methods, this is used to refer to the receiver of the method (the object being messaged). 

The SFA COM function “signatures” may use a different notation from SFA SQL. COM notation is more familiar 
for COM programmers. However, UML notation is used throughout this part of OGC 05-126. There may also be 
methods used in this Specification that differ from one part to another. Where this is the case, the differences are 
shown within the part. 

This part of OGC Simple Feature Access implements a profile of the spatial schema described in ISO 19107:2003, 
Geographic information ⎯ Spatial schema. Annex A provides a detailed mapping of the schema in this part of 
SFA with the schema described in ISO 19107:2003.

Geographic information — Simple feature access — 
Part 1: Common architecture 

1 Scope 

This specification establishes a common architecture and defines terms to use within the architecture. 

This specification does not attempt to standardize and does not depend upon any part of the mechanism by which 
Types are added and maintained, including the following: 

a) syntax and functionality provided for defining types; 

b) syntax and functionality provided for defining functions; 

c) physical storage of type instances in the database; 

d) specific terminology used to refer to User Defined Types, for example UDT. 

This specification does standardize names and geometric definitions for Types for Geometry. 

This specification does not place any requirements on how to define the Geometry Types in the internal schema 
nor does it place any requirements on when or how or who defines the Geometry Types. 

2 Conformance 

In order to conform to this specification, an implementation shall satisfy the requirements of one or more test 
suites specified in the other parts of ISO 19125.

4 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, all definitions from Part 1 of this specification and the following terms and 
definitions apply. 

4.1 
boundary 
set that represents the limit of an entity 

NOTE Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a 
collection of objects that represent those points. In other arenas, the term is used metaphorically to 
describe the transition between an entity and the rest of its domain of discourse. 

[ISO 19107] 

4.2 
buffer 
geometric object (4.14) that contains all direct positions (4.7) whose distance from a specified geometric object 
is less than or equal to a given distance 

[ISO 19107] 

4.3 
coordinate 
one of a sequence of n-numbers designating the position of a point (4.17) in n-dimensional space 

NOTE In a coordinate reference system, the numbers shall be qualified by units. 

[adapted from ISO 19111] 

4.4 
coordinate dimension 
number of measurements or axes needed to describe a position in a coordinate system (4.6) 

[ISO 19107] 

4.5 
coordinate reference system 
coordinate system (4.6) that is related to the real world by a datum 

[adapted from ISO 19111] 

4.6 
coordinate system 
set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates (4.3) are to be assigned to each point (4.17) 

[ISO 19111] 

4.7 
curve 
topological 1-dimensional geometric primitive (4.15), representing the continuous image of a line 

NOTE The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends 
are identical, and the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is 
called the start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the 



OGC 06-103r3 

 

10 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 

“continuous image of a line” clause. A topological theorem states that a continuous image of a connected 
set is connected. 

 The term “1-dimentional” refers to the topological dimension of the primitive. In this case, it means that 
each point not on the boundary is an element in a topological open set within the curve which is 
isomorphic to an open interval (0, 1). For this specification, the coordinate dimension can be 2 (for x and 
y), 3 (with z or m added), or 4 (with both z and m added). The ordinates x, y and z are spatial, and the 
ordinate m is a measure.  

[ISO 19107] 

4.8 
direct position 
position described by a single set of coordinates (4.3) within a coordinate reference system (4.5) 

[ISO 19107] 

4.9 
end point 
last point (4.17) of a curve (4.7) 

Note: End and start point are related to the orientation of the curve. Any curve representation can be “flipped” 
reversing the end and start, without changing the image of the curve as a set of points (direct positions). 

[ISO 19107] 

4.10 
exterior 
difference between the universe and the closure 

NOTE The concept of exterior is applicable to both topological and geometric complexes. 

[ISO 19107] 

4.11 
feature 
abstraction of real world phenomena 

NOTE A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance is used when only one is 
meant. 

[adapted from ISO 19101] 

4.12 
feature attribute 
characteristic of a feature (4.11) 

NOTE A feature attribute has a name, a data type, and a value domain associated to it. A feature attribute for a 
feature instance also has an attribute value taken from the value domain. No restrictions are implied here 
as to the type of attributes a feature may have. The “geometries” associated to features are just one type 
of feature attribute.  

[adapted from ISO 19101]

4.13 
geometric complex 
set of disjoint geometric primitives (4.15) where the boundary (4.1) of each geometric primitive can be 
represented as the union of other geometric primitives of smaller dimension within the same set 

NOTE The geometric primitives in the set are disjoint in the sense that no direct position is interior to more than 
one geometric primitive. The set is closed under boundary operations, meaning that for each element in 
the geometric complex, there is a collection (also a geometric complex) of geometric primitives that 
represents the boundary of that element. Recall that the boundary of a point (the only 0D primitive object 
type in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the largest dimension geometric primitive is a solid (3D), the 
composition of the boundary operator in this definition terminates after at most 3 steps. It is also the case 
that the boundary of any object is a cycle. 

 Geometric complexes are often referred to as clean geometry or implicit topology, meaning that the 
various topological inconsistencies have usually been removed to obtain the “completeness” of the 
boundary representation.   

[ISO 19107] 

4.14 
geometric object 
spatial object representing a geometric set 

NOTE A geometric object consists of a geometric primitive, a collection of geometric primitives, or a geometric 
complex treated as a single entity. A geometric object may be the spatial representation of an object such 
as a feature or a significant part of a feature. 

 Regardless of the representation, the feature is usually assumed to be topologically closed, in that points 
on the boundary of the feature are assumed to belong to the feature, even though those points may not 
explicitly be represented in the geometric object. When representing a topological entity, geometric 
objects are assumed to not contain their boundaries.  

[ISO 19107] 

4.15 
geometric primitive 
geometric object (4.14) representing a single, connected, homogeneous element of space 

NOTE Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that represent information about geometric 
configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and solids. Contrary to common usage, a geometric 
primitive is open, decomposable (can be broken into smaller objects) because of the inherent continuity of 
space. Primitive are those things that have not been chosen for such decomposition.  

[ISO 19107] 

4.16 
interior 
set of all direct positions (4.7) that are on a geometric object (4.14) but which are not on its boundary (4.1) 

NOTE The interior of a topological object is the continuous image of the interior of any of its geometric 
realizations. This is not included as a definition because it follows from a theorem of topology. Another 
way of saying this is that any point on a geometric object is in its interior if it can be placed inside a 
homeomorphic image of an open set in the Euclidean space of the object’s topological dimension.  

[ISO 19107] 



OGC 06-103r3

4.17 
linear referencing system 
linear positioning system  
positioning system that measures distance from a reference point along a route (feature) 

NOTE  The system includes the complete set of procedures for determining and retaining a record of specific 
points along a linear feature such as the location reference method(s) together with the procedures for 
storing, maintaining, and retrieving location information about points and segments on the highways. 
[NCHRP Synthesis 21, 1974] 

[ISO 19133] 

4.18 
point 
topological 0-dimensional geometric primitive (4.15), representing a position 

NOTE The boundary of a point is the empty set. 

[ISO 19107] 

4.19 
simple feature 
feature with all geometric attributes described piecewise by straight line or planar interpolation between sets of 
points 

Note Interpolation is used on curves and surfaces, which by their nature are an infinite set of points and thus 
not suitable to finite exhaustive representations. Each such geometric entity is decomposed into parts 
which can be expressed locally as parametric, linear combinations of "control points." This is described at 
length in ISO 19107. 

 For curves, each part (called a "segment" in ISO 19107) has two control points P0 (the “start point”) and P1 
(the “end point”). Any other P on the segment can be described using a real number parameter t between 
0.0 and 1.0 in the “vector” equation: 0 1(1 )P tP t P= + − .  

 For surfaces, each part (called a “patch” in ISO 19107) can be viewed as a polygon which can be broken 
into triangles each with three control points P0, P1 and P2. Any other P in the triangle can be described 
using 3 non-negative real numbers whose sum is 1.0 (called “barycentric coordinates”) 

, , ; , , 0; 1.0a b c a b c a b c∈ > + + =¡  in the vector equation: 210 cPbPaPP ++= . 

4.20 
start point 
first point (4.17) of a curve (4.7) 

[ISO 19107] 

4.21 
surface 
topological 2-dimensional geometric primitive (4.15), locally representing a continuous image of a region of a 
plane 

NOTE The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate the limits of the surface.

6.1 Geometry object model 

6.1.1 Overview 

This subclause describes the object model for simple feature geometry. The simple feature geometry object 
model is Distributed Computing Platform neutral and uses UML notation. The object model for geometry  
is shown in Figure 1. The base Geometry class has subclasses for Point, Curve, Surface and GeometryCollection. 
Each geometric object is associated with a Spatial Reference System, which describes the coordinate space in 
which the geometric object is defined.

Figure 1: Geometry class hierarchy 
Figure 1 is based on an extended Geometry model with specialized 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional collection classes 
named MultiPoint, MultiLineString and MultiPolygon for modeling geometries corresponding to collections of 
Points, LineStrings and Polygons, respectively. MultiCurve and MultiSurface are introduced as superclasses that 
generalize the collection interfaces to handle Curves and Surfaces. Figure 1 shows aggregation lines between the 
leaf-collection classes and their element classes; the aggregation lines for non-leaf-collection classes are 
described in the text. Non-homogeneous collections are instances of GeometryCollection.   
The attributes, methods and assertions for each Geometry class are described below. In describing methods, this 
is used to refer to the receiver of the method (the object being messaged). 

6.1.2 Geometry 

6.1.2.1 Description 

Geometry is the root class of the hierarchy. Geometry is an abstract (non-instantiable) class. 

The instantiable subclasses of Geometry defined in this Specification are restricted to 0, 1 and  
2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in 2, 3 or 4-dimensional coordinate space (ℜ2, ℜ3 or ℜ4). Geometry 
values in R2 have points with coordinate values for x and y. Geometry values in R3 have points with coordinate 
values for x, y and z or for x, y and m. Geometry values in R4 have points with coordinate values for x, y, z and m. 
The interpretation of the coordinates is subject to the coordinate reference systems associated to the point. All 
coordinates within a geometry object should be in the same coordinate reference systems. Each coordinate shall 
be unambiguously associated to a coordinate reference system either directly or through its containing geometry.  

The z coordinate of a point is typically, but not necessarily, represents altitude or elevation. The m coordinate 
represents a measurement.  



OGC 06-103r3 

 

16 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 

All Geometry classes described in this specification are defined so that instances of Geometry are topologically 
closed, i.e. all represented geometries include their boundary as point sets. This does not affect their 
representation, and open version of the same classes may be used in other circumstances, such as topological 
representations.

Figure 2: Geometry class operations 

6.1.2.2 Basic methods on geometric objects 

⎯ Dimension ( ): Integer — The inherent dimension of this geometric object, which must be less than or equal 
to the coordinate dimension. In non-homogeneous collections, this will return the largest topological 
dimension of the contained objects.  

⎯ GeometryType ( ): String — Returns the name of the instantiable subtype of Geometry of which this 
geometric object is an instantiable member. The name of the subtype of Geometry is returned as a string. 

⎯ SRID ( ): Integer — Returns the Spatial Reference System ID for this geometric object. This will normally be a 
foreign key to an index of reference systems stored in either the same or some other datastore. 



OGC 06-103r3 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 17
 

⎯ Envelope ( ): Geometry — The minimum bounding box for this Geometry, returned as a Geometry. The 
polygon is defined by the corner points of the bounding box [(MINX, MINY), (MAXX, MINY), (MAXX, MAXY), 
(MINX, MAXY), (MINX, MINY)]. Minimums for Z and M may be added. The simplest representation of an 
Envelope is as two direct positions, one containing all the minimums, and another all the maximums. In some 
cases, this coordinate will be outside the range of validity for the Spatial Reference System. 

⎯ AsText ( ): String — Exports this geometric object to a specific Well-known Text Representation of Geometry. 

⎯ AsBinary ( ): Binary — Exports this geometric object to a specific Well-known Binary Representation of 
Geometry. 

⎯ IsEmpty ( ): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object is the empty Geometry. If true, then this 
geometric object represents the empty point set ∅ for the coordinate space. The return type is integer, but is 
interpreted as Boolean, TRUE=1, FALSE=0.  

⎯ IsSimple ( ): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object has no anomalous geometric points, such 
as self intersection or self tangency. The description of each instantiable geometric class will include the 
specific conditions that cause an instance of that class to be classified as not simple. The return type is 
integer, but is interpreted as Boolean, TRUE=1, FALSE=0.  

⎯ Is3D ( ): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object has z coordinate values. 

⎯ IsMeasured ( ): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object has m coordinate values. 

⎯ Boundary ( ): Geometry — Returns the closure of the combinatorial boundary of this geometric object 
(Reference [1], section 3.12.2). Because the result of this function is a closure, and hence topologically 
closed, the resulting boundary can be represented using representational Geometry primitives (Reference [1], 
section 3.12.2). The return type is integer, but is interpreted as Boolean, TRUE=1, FALSE=0.  

6.1.2.3 Methods for testing spatial relations between geometric objects 

The methods in this subclause are defined and described in more detail following the description of the sub-types 
of Geometry. For each of the following, the return type is integer, but is interpreted as Boolean, TRUE=1,

⎯ Equals (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object is “spatially 
equal” to anotherGeometry.

disjoint” from anotherGeometry.

intersects” anotherGeometry.

touches” anotherGeometry.  

⎯ Crosses (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object “spatially 
crosses’ anotherGeometry.

⎯ Contains (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object “spatially 
contains” anotherGeometry. 

⎯ Overlaps (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this geometric object “spatially 
overlaps” anotherGeometry. 

⎯ Relate (anotherGeometry: Geometry, intersectionPatternMatrix: String): Integer — Returns 1 (TRUE) if this 
geometric object is spatially related to anotherGeometry by testing for intersections between the interior, 
boundary and exterior of the two geometric objects as specified by the values in the intersectionPatternMatrix. 
This returns FALSE if all the tested intersections are empty except exterior (this) intersect exterior (another). 

⎯ LocateAlong (mValue: Double): Geometry — Returns a derived geometry collection value that matches the 
specified m coordinate value. See Subclause 6.1.2.6 “Measures on Geometry” for more details. 

⎯ LocateBetween (mStart: Double, mEnd: Double): Geometry — Returns a derived geometry collection value 
that matches the specified range of m coordinate values inclusively. See Subclause 6.1.2.6 “Measures on 
Geometry” for more details. 

6.1.2.4 Methods that support spatial analysis 

All of the following are geometric analysis and depend on the accuracy of the coordinate representations and the 
limitations of linear interpolation in this specification. The accuracy of the result at a fine level will be limited by 
these and related issues.  

⎯ Distance (anotherGeometry: Geometry):Double — Returns the shortest distance between any two Points in 
the two geometric objects as calculated in the spatial reference system of this geometric object. Because the 
geometries are closed, it is possible to find a point on each geometric object involved, such that the distance 
between these 2 points is the returned distance between their geometric objects.  

⎯ Buffer (distance: Double): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents all Points whose distance 
from this geometric object is less than or equal to distance. Calculations are in the spatial reference system of 
this geometric object. Because of the limitations of linear interpolation, there will often be some relatively 
small error in this distance, but it should be near the resolution of the coordinates used.  

⎯ ConvexHull ( ): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents the convex hull of this geometric 
object. Convex hulls, being dependent on straight lines, can be accurately represented in linear interpolations 
for any geometry restricted to linear interpolations.  

⎯ Intersection (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents the 
Point set intersection of this geometric object with anotherGeometry. 

⎯ Union (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents the Point set 
union of this geometric object with anotherGeometry. 

⎯ Difference (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents the Point 
set difference of this geometric object with anotherGeometry. 

⎯ SymDifference (anotherGeometry: Geometry): Geometry — Returns a geometric object that represents the 
Point set symmetric difference of this geometric object with anotherGeometry.

6.1.2.5 Use of Z and M coordinate values 

A Point value may include a z coordinate value. The z coordinate value traditionally represents the third 
dimension (i.e. 3D). In a Geographic Information System (GIS) this may be height above or below sea level. For 
example: A map might have point identifying the position of a mountain peak by its location on the earth, with the 
x and y coordinate values, and the height of the mountain, with the z coordinate value. 

A Point value may include an m coordinate value. The m coordinate value allows the application environment to 
associate some measure with the point values. For example: A stream network may be modeled as multilinestring 
value with the m coordinate values measuring the distance from the mouth of stream. The method 
LocateBetween may be used to find all the parts of the stream that are between, for example, 10 and 12 
kilometers from the mouth. There are no constraints on the m coordinate values in a Geometry (e.g., the m 
coordinate values do not have to be continually increasing along a LineString value).  

Observer methods returning Point values include z and m coordinate values when they are present. 

Spatial operations work in the "map geometry" of the data and will therefore not reflect z or m values in 
calculations (e.g., Equals, Length) or in generation of new geometry values (e.g., Buffer, ConvexHull, Intersection). 
This is done by projecting the geometric objects onto the horizontal plane to obtain a "footprint" or "shadow" of the 
objects for the purposed of map calculations. In other words, it is possible to store and obtain z (and m) 
coordinate values but they are ignored in all other operations which are based on map geometries. 
Implementations are free to include true 3D geometric operations, but should be consistent with ISO 19107.. 

6.1.2.6 Measures on Geometry 

The LocateAlong and LocateBetween methods derive MultiPoint or MultiCurve values from the given geometry 
that match a measure or a specific range of measures from the start measure to the end measure. The 
LocateAlong method is a variation of the LocateBetween method where the start measure and end measure are 
equal. (See SQL/MM [1]) 

6.1.2.6.1 Empty Sets 

A null value is returned for empty sets. 

6.1.2.6.2 Geometry values without m coordinate values. 

An empty set of type Point is returned for geometry values without m coordinate values. 

6.1.2.6.3 Zero-dimensional geometry values 

Only points in the 0-dimensional geometry values with m coordinate values between SM and EM inclusively are 
returned as multipoint value. If no matching m coordinate values are found, then an empty set of type Point is 
returned. 
 
For example: 

a) If LocateAlong is invoked with an M value of 4 on a MultiPoint value with well-known text 
representation:  
    multipoint m(1 0 4, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 4, 5 3 4) 
then the result is the following  MultiPoint value with well-known text representation: 
    multipoint m(1 0 4, 3 1 4, 5 3 4) 

b) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 2 and an EM value of 4 on a MultiPoint value with 
well-known text representation: 
    multipoint m(1 0 4, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 4, 5 3 5, 9 5 3, 7 6 7) 
then the result is the following MultiPoint value with well-known text representation: 
    multipoint m(1 0 4, 1 2 2, 3 1 4, 9 5 3)

c) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 1 and an EM value of 4 on a Point value with well-
known text representation: 
    point m(7 6 7) 
then the result is the following MultiPoint value with well-known text representation: 
    point m empty 

d) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 7 and an EM value of 7 on a Point value with well-
known text representation:  
    point m(7 6 7) 
then the result is the following  MultiPoint value with well-known text representation: 
    multipoint m(7 6 7) 

6.1.2.6.4 One-dimensional geometry value 

Interpolation is used to determine any points on the 1-dimensional geometry with an m coordinate value between 
mStart and mEnd inclusively. The implementation-defined interpolation algorithm is used to estimate values 
between measured values, usually using a mathematical function. The interpolation is within a Curve element and 
not across Curve elements in a MultiCurve. For example, given a measure of 6 and a 2-point LineString where the 
m coordinate value of start point is 4 and the m coordinate value of the end point is 8, since 6 is halfway between 
4 and 8, the interpolation algorithm would be a point on the LineString halfway between the start and end points. 

The results are produced in a geometry collection. If there are consecutive points in the 1-dimensional geometry 
with an m coordinate value between mStart and mEnd inclusively, then a curve value element is added to the 
geometry collection to represent the curve elements between these consecutive points. Any disconnected points 
in the 1-dimensional geometry values with m coordinate values between mStart and mEnd inclusively are also 
added to the geometry collection. If no matching m coordinate values are found, then an empty set of type 
ST_Point is returned. 
For example: 

a) If LocateAlong is invoked with an M value of 4 on a LineString value with well-known text 
representation: 
    LineStringM(1 0 0, 3 1 4, 5 3 4, 5 5 1, 5 6 4, 7 8 4, 9 9 0) 
then the result is the following MultiLineString value with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((3 1 4, 5 3 4), (5 6 4, 7 8 4)) 

b) If LocateBetween is invoked with an mStart value of 2 and an mend value of 4 on a LineString value 
with well-known text representation: 
    LineStringM(1 0 0, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 3, 5 3 4, 9 5 5, 7 6 6) 
then the result is the following MultiLineString value with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((1 2 2, 3 1 3, 5 3 4)) 

c) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 6 and an EM value of 9 on a LineString value with 
well-known text representation: 
    LineStringM(1 0 0, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 3, 5 3 4, 9 5 5, 7 6 6) 
then the result is the following MultiPoint value with well-known text representation: 
    MultiPointM(7 6 6) 

d) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 2 and an EM value of 4 on a MultiLineString value 
with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((1 0 0, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 3), (4 5 3, 5 3 4, 9 5 5, 7 6 6)) 
then the result is the following MultiLineString value with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((1 2 2, 3 1 3),(4 5 3, 5 3 4)) 

e) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 1 and an EM value of 3 on a LineString value with 
well-known text representation: 
    LineStringM(0 0 0, 2 2 2, 4 4 4) 
then the result may be the following MultiLineString value with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((1 1 1, 2 2 2, 3 3 3)) 

f) If LocateBetween is invoked with an SM value of 7 and an EM value of 9 on a MultiLineString value 
with well-known text representation: 
    MultiLineStringM((1 0 0, 1 1 1, 1 2 2, 3 1 3), (4 5 3, 5 3 4, 9 5 5, 7 6 6)) 



OGC 06-103r3

then the result is the following MultiLineString value with well-known text representation: 
    PointM empty 

6.1.2.6.5 Two-dimensional geometry value 

The computation for 2-dimensional geometries is implementation-defined. 

6.1.3 GeometryCollection 

6.1.3.1 Description 

A GeometryCollection is a geometric object that is a collection of some number of geometric objects. 

All the elements in a GeometryCollection shall be in the same Spatial Reference System. This is also the Spatial 
Reference System for the GeometryCollection. 

GeometryCollection places no other constraints on its elements. Subclasses of GeometryCollection may restrict 
membership based on dimension and may also place other constraints on the degree of spatial overlap between 
elements.

6.1.3.2 Methods 

By the nature of digital representations, collections are inherently ordered by the underlying storage mechanism. 
Two collections whose difference is only this order are spatially equal and will return equivalent results in any 
geometric-defined operations. 

⎯ NumGeometries ( ): Integer — Returns the number of geometries in this GeometryCollection. 

⎯ GeometryN (N: integer): Geometry — Returns the Nth geometry in this GeometryCollection. 

6.1.4 Point 

6.1.4.1 Description 

A Point is a 0-dimensional geometric object and represents a single location in coordinate space. A Point has an 
x-coordinate value, a y-coordinate value. If called for by the associated Spatial Reference System, it may also 
have coordinate values for z and m. 

The boundary of a Point is the empty set.

⎯ M ( ):Double — The m-coordinate value for this Point, if it has one. Returns NIL otherwise. 

6.1.5 MultiPoint 

A MultiPoint is a 0-dimensional GeometryCollection. The elements of a MultiPoint are restricted to Points. The 
Points are not connected or ordered in any semantically important way (see the discussion at 
GeometryCollection). 

A MultiPoint is simple if no two Points in the MultiPoint are equal (have identical coordinate values in X and Y). 
Every MultiPoint is spatially equal under the definition in Clause 6.1.15.3 to a simple Multipoint.  

The boundary of a MultiPoint is the empty set. 

6.1.6 Curve 

6.1.6.1 Description 

A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a sequence of Points, with the subtype of Curve 
specifying the form of the interpolation between Points. This specification defines only one subclass of Curve, 
LineString, which uses linear interpolation between Points. 

A Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object that is the homeomorphic image of a real, closed, interval: 

D = [a, b] = {t∈ℜ⏐ a ≤ t ≤ b} 

under a mapping

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 23
 

f :[a, b] → ℜn 

where n is the coordinate dimension of the underlying Spatial Reference System.  

A Curve is simple if it does not pass through the same Point twice with the possible exception of the two end 
points (Reference [1], section 3.12.7.3): 

∀ c ∈ Curve, [a, b] = c.Domain, c =: f :[a, b] → ℜ n 
c.IsSimple ⇔ ∀ x1, x2 ∈ [a, b]: [ f(x1)=f(x2) ∧ x1<x2] ⇒ [x1=a ∧ x2=b] 
 

A Curve is closed if its start Point is equal to its end Point (Reference [1], section 3.12.7.3). 
c.IsClosed ⇔ [f(a) = f(b)] 

The boundary of a closed Curve is empty. 
c.IsClosed ⇔ [c.boundary = ∅] 

A Curve that is simple and closed is a Ring. 

The boundary of a non-closed Curve consists of its two end Points (Reference [1], section 3.12.3.2). 

A Curve is defined as topologically closed, that is, it contains its endpoints f(a) and f(b).

simple (does not pass through the same Point more than once). 

6.1.7 LineString, Line, LinearRing 

6.1.7.1 Description 

A LineString is a Curve with linear interpolation between Points. Each consecutive pair of Points defines a Line 
segment. 

A Line is a LineString with exactly 2 Points.

6.1.8 MultiCurve 

6.1.8.1 Description 

A MultiCurve is a 1-dimensional GeometryCollection whose elements are Curves as in Figure 3. 



OGC 06-103r3 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 25
 

MultiCurve is a non-instantiable class in this specification; it defines a set of methods for its subclasses and is 
included for reasons of extensibility. 

A MultiCurve is simple if and only if all of its elements are simple and the only intersections between any two 
elements occur at Points that are on the boundaries of both elements. 

The boundary of a MultiCurve is obtained by applying the “mod 2” union rule: A Point is in the boundary of a 
MultiCurve if it is in the boundaries of an odd number of elements of the MultiCurve (Reference [1], section 
3.12.3.2). 

A MultiCurve is closed if all of its elements are closed. The boundary of a closed MultiCurve is always empty. 

A MultiCurve is defined as topologically closed.

Curves.

6.1.10 Surface 

6.1.10.1 Description 

A Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object. 

A simple Surface may consists of a single “patch” that is associated with one “exterior boundary” and 0 or more 
“interior” boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a 
simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical, the projection 
onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.  

Polyhedral Surfaces are formed by “stitching” together such simple Surfaces patches along their common 
boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the 
orientation of their planar normals (Reference [1], sections 3.12.9.1, and 3.12.9.3). If all the patches are in 
alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be 
represented as a single patch if it is connected.  

The boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its “exterior” and “interior” 
boundaries (Reference [1], section 3.12.9.4). 

The only instantiable subclasses of Surface defined in this specification are Polygon and PolyhedralSurface.  A 
Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar. A PolyhedralSurface is a simple surface, consisting of some number of 
Polygon patches or facets. If a PolyhedralSurface is closed, then it bounds a solid. A MultiSurface containing a set 
of closed PolyhedralSurfaces can be used to represent a Solid object with holes.

6.1.11 Polygon, Triangle 

6.1.11.1 Description 

A Polygon is a planar Surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. Each interior 
boundary defines a hole in the Polygon. A Triangle is a polygon with 3 distinct, non-collinear vertices and no 
interior boundary.  

The exterior boundary LinearRing defines the “top” of the surface which is the side of the surface from which the 
exterior boundary appears to traverse the boundary in a counter clockwise direction. The interior LinearRings will 
have the opposite orientation, and appear as clockwise when viewed from the “top”, 

The assertions for Polygons (the rules that define valid Polygons) are as follows: 

a) Polygons are topologically closed; 

b) The boundary of a Polygon consists of a set of LinearRings that make up its exterior and interior boundaries; 



OGC 06-103r3 

 

28 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 

c) No two Rings in the boundary cross and the Rings in the boundary of a Polygon may intersect at a Point but 
only as a tangent, e.g.  

∀ P ∈ Polygon, ∀ c1, c2 ∈ P.Boundary(), c1 ≠ c2,  
∀ p, q ∈ Point, p, q ∈c1, p ≠ q , [ p ∈ c2 ⇒ q ∉ c2]; 
 

d) A Polygon may not have cut lines, spikes or punctures e.g.:  

∀ P ∈ Polygon, P = P.Interior.Closure; 

 

e) The interior of every Polygon is a connected point set; 

f) The exterior of a Polygon with 1 or more holes is not connected. Each hole defines a connected component of 
the exterior. 

In the above assertions, interior, closure and exterior have the standard topological definitions. The combination 
of (a) and (c) makes a Polygon a regular closed Point set. Polygons are simple geometric objects. Figure 11 
shows some examples of Polygons. 

 
Figure 11: Examples of Polygons  

with 1 (a), 2 (b) and 3 (c) Rings, respectively 
 

Figure 12 shows some examples of geometric objects that violate the above assertions and are not representable

6.1.12 PolyhedralSurface 

6.1.12.1 Description 

A PolyhedralSurface is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments. For each 
pair of polygons that “touch”, the common boundary shall be expressible as a finite collection of LineStrings. Each 
such LineString shall be part of the boundary of at most 2 Polygon patches. A TIN (triangulated irregular network) 
is a PolyhedralSurface consisting only of Triangle patches.  

For any two polygons that share a common boundary, the “top” of the polygon shall be consistent. This means 
that when two LinearRings from these two Polygons traverse the common boundary segment, they do so in 
opposite directions. Since the Polyhedral surface is contiguous, all polygons will be thus consistently oriented. 
This means that a non-oriented surface (such as Möbius band) shall not have single surface representations. 
They may be represented by a MultiSurface. Figure 14 shows an example of such a consistently oriented surface 
(from the top). The arrows indicate the ordering of the linear rings that from the boundary of the polygon in which 
they are located.  

 
Figure 14: Polyhedral Surface with consistent orientation 

If each such LineString is the boundary of exactly 2 Polygon patches, then the PolyhedralSurface is a simple, 
closed polyhedron and is topologically isomorphic to the surface of a sphere. By the Jordan Surface Theorem 
(Jordan’s Theorem for 2-spheres), such polyhedrons enclose a solid topologically isomorphic to the interior of a 
sphere; the ball. In this case, the “top” of the surface will either point inward or outward of the enclosed finite solid. 
If outward, the surface is the exterior boundary of the enclosed surface. If inward, the surface is the interior of the 
infinite complement of the enclosed solid. A Ball with some number of voids (holes) inside can thus be presented 
as one exterior boundary shell, and some number in interior boundary shells.  

6.1.12.2 Methods

⎯ PatchN (N: Integer): Polygon ⎯ Returns a polygon in this surface, the order is arbitrary.  

⎯ BoundingPolygons (p: Polygon): MultiPolygon  ⎯  Returns the collection of polygons in this surface that 
bounds the given polygon “p” for any polygon “p” in the surface. 

⎯ IsClosed (): Integer ⎯ Returns 1 (True) if the polygon closes on itself, and thus has no boundary and 
encloses a solid

6.1.13 MultiSurface 

6.1.13.1 Description 

A MultiSurface is a 2-dimensional GeometryCollection whose elements are Surfaces, all using coordinates from 
the same coordinate reference system. The geometric interiors of any two Surfaces in a MultiSurface may not 
intersect in the full coordinate system. The boundaries of any two coplanar elements in a MultiSurface may 
intersect, at most, at a finite number of Points. If they were to meet along a curve, they could be merged into a 
single surface.  

MultiSurface is an instantiable class in this Specification, and may be used to represent heterogeneous surfaces 
collections of polygons and polyhedral surfaces. It defines a set of methods for its subclasses. The subclass of 
MultiSurface is MultiPolygon corresponding to a collection of Polygons only. Other collections shall use 
MultiSurface.  
NOTE: The geometric relationships and sets are the common geometric ones in the full coordinate systems. The 

use of the 2D map operations defined Clause 6.1.15 may classify the elements of a valid 3D MultiSurface 
as having overlapping interiors in their 2D projections.

6.1.13.2 Methods 

MultiSurface inherits operations NumGeometries and GeometryN from GeometryCollection to access its individual 
component surfaces. 

⎯ Area ( ): Double — The area of this MultiSurface, as measured in the spatial reference system of this 
MultiSurface. 

⎯ Centroid ( ): Point — The mathematical centroid for this MultiSurface. The result is not guaranteed to be on 
this MultiSurface. 

⎯ PointOnSurface ( ): Point — A Point guaranteed to be on this MultiSurface. 

6.1.14 MultiPolygon 

A MultiPolygon is a MultiSurface whose elements are Polygons. 

The assertions for MultiPolygons are as follows. 

a) The interiors of 2 Polygons that are elements of a MultiPolygon may not intersect. 

∀M∈MultiPolygon, ∀Pi,Pj∈M.Geometries(),i≠j,  
Interior(Pi)∩Interior(Pj) = ∅; 

 
b) The boundaries of any 2 Polygons that are elements of a MultiPolygon may not “cross” and may touch at only 

a finite number of Points. 

∀M∈MultiPolygon, ∀Pi,Pj∈M.Geometries(),  
∀ci,cj∈Curve ci∈Pi.Boundaries(), cj∈Pj.Boundaries()  
∃k∈Integer ∋ ci∩cj = {p1,…,pk | pm∈Point, 0<m<k}; 

 

NOTE Crossing is prevented by assertion (a) above. 

c) A MultiPolygon is defined as topologically closed. 



OGC 06-103r3 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 33
 

d) A MultiPolygon may not have cut lines, spikes or punctures, a MultiPolygon is a regular closed Point set: 

∀ M ∈ MultiPolygon, M = Closure(Interior(M)) 
 

e) The interior of a MultiPolygon with more than 1 Polygon is not connected; the number of connected 
components of the interior of a MultiPolygon is equal to the number of Polygons in the MultiPolygon. 

The boundary of a MultiPolygon is a set of closed Curves (LineStrings) corresponding to the boundaries of its 
element Polygons. Each Curve in the boundary of the MultiPolygon is in the boundary of exactly 1 element 
Polygon, and every Curve in the boundary of an element Polygon is in the boundary of the MultiPolygon. 

The reader is referred to works by Worboys et al.([13], [14]) and Clementini et al. ([5], [6]) for the definition and 
specification of MultiPolygons. 

Figure 17 shows four examples of valid MultiPolygons with 1, 3, 2 and 2 Polygon elements, respectively.

NOTE The subclass of Surface named Polyhedral Surface as described in Reference [1], is a faceted Surface 
whose facets are Polygons. A Polyhedral Surface is not a MultiPolygon because it violates the rule for 
MultiPolygons that the boundaries of the element Polygons intersect only at a finite number of Points.

6.1.15 Relational operators 

6.1.15.1 Background 

The relational operators are Boolean methods that are used to test for the existence of a specified topological 
spatial relationship between two geometric objects as they would be represented on a map. Topological spatial 
relationships between two geometric objects have been a topic of extensive study; see References in the 
Bibliography numbered [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10]. The basic approach to comparing two geometric objects 
is to project the objects onto the 2D horizontal coordinate reference system representing the Earth's surface, and 
then to make pair-wise tests of the intersections between the interiors, boundaries and exteriors of the two 
projections and to classify the map relationship between the two geometric objects based on the entries in the 
resulting 3 by 3 ‘intersection’ matrix. The concepts of interior, boundary and exterior are well defined as sets of 
point geometry, and abstracted in general topology; see Reference [4].  

It is important to note that the calculation of the following operations will give equivalent results whether the 
calculations are done using classical geometric representations or these same calculations are done with 
algebraic techniques in a well-structured and properly defined equivalent topological structure.  

These concepts are applied in this standard for defining spatial relationships between 2-dimensional objects in 2-
dimensional space (ℜ2) by the projection of the objects onto the horizontal surface usually represented in a map. 
This will give a different result than would be obtained if the full 3D geometry (or its corresponding 3D topology) 
because of the changes induced in the projection of the objects onto the horizontal map projection. It would be 
possible to define a full 3D set of operations, but the increase in computational complexity can be prohibitive to 
most implementations, and is generally not supported in many geographic information systems or other 
applications dealing with significant volumes of "mapping data." Specification of full 3D operators following this 
same pattern for higher dimensions is reserved for a future version of this standard.  

NOTE It is important to remember that when reading this standard, that when spoken of in the abstract the 
relationship underlying these operations will refer to the full relationship in the coordinate reference 
system of the objects being spoken of, unless the operations defined in these clauses is specifically 
referenced.   

In order to apply the concepts of interior, boundary and exterior to 1- and 0-dimensional objects in ℜ2, a 
combinatorial topology approach shall be applied (Reference [1], section 3.12.3.2). This approach is based on the 
accepted definitions of the boundaries, interiors and exteriors for simplicial complexes (see Reference [12]) and 
yields the following results. 

The boundary of a geometric object is a set of geometric objects of the next lower dimension. The boundary of a 
Point or a MultiPoint is the empty set. The boundary of a non-closed Curve consists of its two end Points; the 
boundary of a closed Curve is empty. The boundary of a MultiCurve consists of those Points that are in the 
boundaries of an odd number of its element Curves. The boundary of a Polygon consists of its set of Rings. The 
boundary of a MultiPolygon consists of the set of Rings of its Polygons. The boundary of an arbitrary collection of 
geometric objects whose interiors are disjoint consists of geometric objects drawn from the boundaries of the 
element geometric objects by application of the “mod 2” union rule (Bibliographic Reference [1], section 3.12.3.2). 

The domain of geometric objects considered is those that are topologically closed. The interior of a geometric 
object consists of those Points that are left when the boundary Points are removed. The exterior of a geometric 
object consists of Points not in the interior or boundary. 

Studies on the relationships between two geometric objects both of maximal dimension in ℜ1 and ℜ2 considered 
pair-wise intersections between the interior and boundary sets and led to the definition of a four-intersection 
model; see Reference [8]. The model was extended to consider the exterior of the input geometric objects, 
resulting in a nine-intersection model (see Reference [11]) and further extended to include information on the 



OGC 06-103r3

dimension of the results of the pair-wise intersections resulting in a dimensionally extended nine-intersection 
model; see Reference [5]. These extensions allow the model to express spatial relationships between points, lines 
and areas, including areas with holes and multi-component lines and areas; see Reference [6]. 

6.1.15.2 The Dimensionally Extended Nine-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) 

Given a geometric object a, let I(a), B(a) and E(a) represent the interior, boundary and exterior of “a”, respectively. 

Let dim(x) return the maximum dimension (-1, 0, 1, or 2) of the geometric objects in x, with a numeric value of -1 
corresponding to dim(∅). 

The intersection of any two of I(a), B(a) and E(a) can result in a set of geometric objects, x, of mixed dimension. 
For example, the intersection of the boundaries of two Polygons may consist of a point and a line. 

Table 1 shows the general form of the dimensionally extended nine-intersection matrix (DE-9IM). 

Table 1: The DE-9IM 

 Interior Boundary Exterior 

Interior dim(I(a)∩I(b)) dim(I(a)∩B(b)) dim(I(a)∩E(b)) 

Boundary dim(B(a)∩I(b)) dim(B(a)∩B(b)) dim(B(a)∩E(b)) 

Exterior dim(E(a)∩I(b)) dim(E(a)∩B(b)) dim(E(a)∩E(b)) 

 

For regular, topologically closed input geometric objects, computing the dimension of the intersection of the 
interior, boundary and exterior sets does not have, as a prerequisite, the explicit computation and representation 
of these sets. To compute if the interiors of two regular closed Polygons intersect, and to ascertain the dimension 
of this intersection, it is not necessary to explicitly represent the interior of the two Polygons, which are 
topologically open sets, as separate geometric objects. In most cases, the dimension of the intersection value at a 
cell is highly constrained, given the type of the two geometric objects. In the Line-Area case, the only possible 
values for the interior-interior cell are drawn from {-1, 1} and in the Area-Area case, the only possible values for 
the interior-interior cell are drawn from {-1, 2}. In such cases, no work beyond detecting the intersection is required. 

Figure 8 shows an example DE-9IM for the case where “a” and “b” are two Polygons that overlap.

Figure 19: An example instance and its DE-9IM 
On two geometric objects, a spatial relationship predicate can be expressed as a formula that takes as input a 
pattern matrix representing the set of acceptable values for the DE-9IM for the two geometric objects. If the spatial 
relationship between the two geometric objects corresponds to one of the acceptable values as represented by 
the pattern matrix, then the predicate returns TRUE. 

The pattern matrix consists of a set of nine pattern-values, one for each cell in the matrix. The possible pattern-
values of p are {T, F, *, 0, 1, 2} and their meanings for any cell where x is the intersection set for the cell are as 
follows: 

p = T ⇒ dim(x) ∈ {0, 1, 2}, i.e. x ≠ ∅ 
p = F ⇒ dim(x) = -1, i.e. x = ∅ 
p = * ⇒ dim(x) ∈ {-1, 0, 1, 2}, i.e. Don’t Care 
p = 0 ⇒ dim(x) = 0 
p = 1 ⇒ dim(x) = 1 
p = 2 ⇒ dim(x) = 2 
 

The pattern matrix can be represented as an array or list of nine characters in row major order. As an example, 
the following code fragment could be used to test for “Overlap” between two areas: 

char * overlapMatrix = “T*T***T**”;  
Geometry* a, b; 
Boolean b = a->Relate(b, overlapMatrix); 
 

6.1.15.3 Named spatial relationship predicates based on the DE-9IM 

The Relate predicate based on the pattern matrix has the advantage that clients can test for a large number of 
spatial relationships and fine tune the particular relationship being tested. It has the disadvantage that it is a 
lower-level building block and does not have a corresponding natural language equivalent. Users of the proposed 
system include IT developers using the COM API from a language such as Visual Basic, and interactive SQL 
users who may wish, for example, to select all features ‘spatially within’ a query Polygon, in addition to more 
spatially “sophisticated” GIS developers. 

To address the needs of such users, a set of named spatial relationship predicates has been defined for the DE-
9IM; see References [5, 6]. The five predicates are named Disjoint, Touches, Crosses, Within and Overlaps. The 
definition of these predicates (see References [5, 6]) is given below. In these definitions, the term P is used to 
refer to 0-dimensional geometries (Points and MultiPoints), L is used to refer to 1-dimensional geometries 
(LineStrings and MultiLineStrings) and A is used to refer to 2-dimensional geometries (Polygons and 
MultiPolygons).

Expressed in terms of the DE-9IM:

        [  (B(a) ∩ I(b) ≠ ∅) ∨ 
         (I(a) ∩ B(b) ≠ ∅) ∨ 
         (B(a) ∩ B(b) ≠ ∅) ] ] 
      ⇔  [ a.Relate(b, “FT*******”) ∨ 
        a.Relate(b, “F**T*****”) ∨ 
        a.Relate(b, “F***T****”) ]

6.2 Annotation Text 

Spatially placed text is a common requirement of applications. Many application have stored their text placement 
information in proprietary manners due lack of a consistent and usable standard. Although the mechanisms for 
text storage have tended to be compatible, the actual format for exchange has been sufficiently different, and, 
therefore, non-standardized to interfere with complete data exchange and common usage. To overcome this 
interoperability gap, this specification, using best engineering practices, defines an implementation of annotation 
text.  

Annotation text is simply placed text that can carry either geographically-related or ad-hoc data and process-
related information is displayable text. This text may be used for display in editors or in simpler maps. It is usually 
lacking in full cartographic quality, but may act as an approximation to such text as needed by any application. 

The primary purpose of standardizing this concept is to enable any application using any version of Simple 
Features data storage or XML to read and write text objects that will describe where and how the text should be 
displayed. This design ensures that applications that do text placement should have no problem storing their 
results and that applications that comply with the specification should have no problem exchanging information on 
text and its placement. 

Unlike spatial geometries, text display is very dependent on client text rendering engines and the style and layout 
attributes applied. The spatial area covered by text is only partially determined by the locating geometry. Style and 
layout attributes along with the actual text and locating geometry are all needed to display text correctly. Thus, it is 
critical to have a place to store these attributes in the feature database. While it is impossible to guarantee 
absolute fidelity of display on all rendering systems, applications can interoperate at a useful level.  

The most common perception of text display is for cartographic purposes, for printed maps of high technical and 
artistic quality. While this is a potential use of placed text, its more every-day use is for identification of features in 
any display, regardless of the purpose of that display. So both cartographic preprint and data collection edit 
displays have a requirement for placed-text, albeit at different levels of artistic quality. The purpose is still the 
same, to aid in the understanding of the “mapped” features, either for map use or feature edit and analysis.  

Text can also be used for less precise annotation purposes and more for quick display of text labels that make a 
display more understandable. The text so placed may not even have any associations to real-world features, but 
may be used to store information pertinent to the process that the data is undergoing at the moment. Thus, in a 
data collecting and edit display, a particular placed text may be used to indicate an error in the data that needs to 
be resolved, such as “sliver,” “gap” and “loop” error in digitization. Here the annotation is placed near the 
geometric error, but is not necessarily associated to a particular feature, as much as to a portion or portions of 
feature geometry objects.  

Annotation text can include text on maps derived from vector information, or text overlays for imagery for 
information not discernable from the image, such as place or street names. In most cases, applications that do 
this have certain rules for creating and re-creating text based on the dynamic view of the mapping application. 
While this specification is not targeted to those usages, there are some allowances for this type of storage if it is 
so desired. In particular, it is allowable to store text that does not scale with the map objects but instead has a 
fixed display size (expressed as “points”, 72 to the inch). However, there are some limitations on this usage 
particularly with spatial indexing. 

6.2.1 Text entities 

A text object consists of an ordered list of independently placed text elements, possibly corresponding to 
individual lines of text in a multiline text display, and an envelope that approximates an outer limit of the text 
elements when placed. Each element has its own text attributes, but they are not used independently.  The first 
element may set the attribute for all following elements and subsequent elements text attributes are only specified 
when a change is required. This behavior just extends that of the metadata text attributes to each element of the 
array  



OGC 06-103r3

A text object consists of a text string and information about its placement. The most important piece of information 
is the geometry to which the text is to refer, here referred to as the location geometry. A second geometry may be 
required to visually connect the placed text and the location geometry, especially where the location geometry is 
crowded in an area with other close-by features. This other geometry is referred to here as a leader line, and is a 
displayable curve of no geographic significance. If indexing is used, the envelope or minimum bounding box of the 
text is a handy piece of information that should be available. In unavailable, the envelope can be calculated from 
the processes of placing the text. Since this is often cumbersome, precalculating the envelope and storing it is 
often the most efficient manner to use this information. The other information associated to the annotation text is 
the various style information, such as the size of the text (usually in units appropriate to the display, such as pixels 
or points), the font used, characteristics of the font. This is represented in UML in Figure 24.

value VARCHAR2(2000)  Optional –Text to place is first derived from the contents of 
VALUE in the current element, if VALUE is not null.  
Otherwise, text is derived from the first non-null preceding 
element VALUE. If all preceding elements have null VALUE 
fields, VALUE is derived from the TEXT_EXPRESSION in the 
metadata table. 

location GEOMETRY Optional – no text will be displayed if LOCATION is NULL. 
Locating geometries can be a point or curve type.   

text attributes XML_TYPE (a character 
string in XML)  

Optional – however no text will be displayed if there is not the 
minimum number of style attributes in either the table metadata 
(the default values) or the instance. 

 

leader line GEOMETRY (a curve 
type) 

Optional – if null, there is no leader line. 

6.2.2 Text attributes 

In addition to the placement information, a set of representation descriptors are needed to properly display the 
text. These are stored with the text information. These text display attributes or properties include the fields listed 
in the following tables: 

Table 4: Attributes for textstyle  

Attribute Type Description Requirements 
and Defaults 

font-family String  Names such as Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman. There is 
no guarantee that the glyphs exist on the client system. These 
names can be delimited by a semi-colon (;) in SVG and 
indicate an ordered list of names to use.  

Ex: Helvetica; Arial  

Required to be 
non-empty 
string. Server 
cannot check if 
valid.  

font-size Float  Size of the text based on the sum of the font ascender, 
descender and internal leading in points. Note that this value is 
used in conjunction with a table metadata value indicating the 
map scale at which this FontSize was determined. In this 
manner, text that is sized along with the geometry objects is 
enabled. If the metadata value is null, the text size is fixed. 
Applications are responsible for calculating the correct size to 
render the text.  

Required 
positive number. 

font-weight enumeration  Allows for Normal, Bold, or 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 
800 or 900. Normal is the same as 200. Bold is the same as 
400.  

Defaults to 
normal.

Attribute Type Description Requirements 
and Defaults 

font-style enumeration  Normal, Italic or Oblique. Oblique is optional in SVG. It is 
meant to the opposite angle of italic, slanted left instead of the 
Italic right. As this has little actual support, the 
recommendation is that clients just use italic.  

Defaults to 
normal.  

text-decoration enumeration  None, underline, line-through and over-line. Underline is drawn 
at the baseline, over-line at the baseline + ascent, line-through 
at baseline + (.5 * ascent). The line is drawn in both the fill and 
stroke colors, if they exist (see below).  

Defaults to 
none.  

letter-spacing Float and 
“normal”  

SVG allows numbers or “normal” Defaults to 
normal.  

word-spacing Float and 
“normal”  

Same as letter spacing but used between words.  Defaults to 
normal.  

fill String (Fill 
Type)  

This specifies the color of the interior of the glyphs. Colors can 
be specified in the following manner:  

1. Well known SVG font names such as black, blue, red. See 
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords .  

2. RGB values specified using function syntax such as 
rgb(255, 0, 255) is a magenta  

3. A literal hex value such as #FF00FF which would be the 
same as the previous RGB example.  

 

In general, the Fill should be regarded as the main color of the 
text. While it should be allowed to render the text with a stroke 
and no fill, applications that support just a single color should 
use the fill color.  

Defaults to 
black.  

fill-opacity Float(0-1)  A percentage that specifies the opacity or translucency of the 
fill. A 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.  

Defaults to 1  

stroke String 
(Stroke 
Type)  

This specifies the color of the outline of the glyphs. Stroke 
allows the same color values as Fill. It is our proposal that we 
define, contrary to SVG, that the stroke be drawn before the fill, 
which creates a very nice shadow background effect around 
the text.  

Defaults to 
none.  

stroke-width Float  A width value specifying the stroke width in points.  Defaults to 0. 
Zero or the lack 
of this attribute 
indicates no 
stroke.  

stroke-opacity Float(0-1)  A percentage that specifies the opacity or translucency of the 
stroke. A 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.  

Defaults to 1

Table 5: Attributes for Text Layout 

Attribute Type Description Requirements 
and Defaults 

horizontal alignment Enumeration 3 allowable values which are: “start”, 
“center”, “end”. The meaning of these 
attributes is such that the appropriate 
part of the text is placed at the point or 
starting point of the geometry. For 
example, start means that the first 
characters of the text is placed there.  
Note that this means the text is 
positioned to the right of the geometry. 

Optional defaults 
to “start” 

vertical alignment Enumeration 4 allowable values which are: “top”, 
“center”, “baseline” and “bottom”. The 
meaning is similar to that of horizontal 
alignment. For example, “top” means 
that the topmost part of the text glyph is 
placed at the geometry start location. 

Optional defaults 
to “top”.  

multiline justification Enumeration 3 allowable values. These are: left, 
center, and right, The meaning of these 
attributes is such that each text line is 
appropriately justified in relation to each 
other. 

Optional as it is not 
needed in single 
line text. Defaults 
to “left”  

multiline spacing Float A value in points determining the space 
between lines of text as measured from 
the bottom of one line to the top of the 
next. 

Optional as it is not 
needed in single 
line text. Defaults 
to 0 which puts 
each line 
immediately below 
the previous one 

6.2.3 XML for Text Attributes 

The following is a schema for the text attribute XML used as metadata in a text metadata table or object and as 
text element overrides. It is presented without a namespace. The values for color are as defined in SVG.

7 Well-known Text Representation for Geometry 

7.1 Component overview 

Each Geometry Type has a Well-known Text Representation that can be used both to construct new instances of 
the type and to convert existing instances to textual form for alphanumeric display. 

7.2 Component description 

7.2.1 BNF Introduction  

The Well-known Text Representation of Geometry is defined below using BNF.  

• The notation “{}” denotes an optional token within the braces; the braces do not appear in the output token 
list.  

• The notation "( )" groups a sequence of tokens into a single token; the parentheses do not appear in the 
output token list. 

• The notation "*" after a token denotes the optional use of multiple instances of that token. 

• A character string without any modifying symbols denotes an instance of that character string as a single 
token. 

• The notation "|" denotes a choice of two tokens, and do not appear in the output token list, 

• The notation "< >" denotes a production defined elsewhere in the list or a basic type.  

• The notation ":=" is a production and the grammar on the left may be replaced with the grammar on the 
right of this symbol. Production is terminated when no undefined production equations are left unresolved.  

The text representation of the instantiable Geometry Types implemented shall conform to this grammar. Well 
known text is case insensitive. Where human readability is important (as in the examples in this specification), an 
“upper camel-case” where each embedded word is capitalized, should be used.  
Note All productions are segregated by coordinate type. This means that any two subelements of any element 

will always have the same coordinate type, which will be the coordinate type of the larger containing 
element.  

The grammar in this and the following 4 clauses has been designed to support a compact and readable textual 
representation of geometric objects. The representation of a geometric object that consists of a set of 
homogeneous components does not include the tags for each embedded component. This first set of productions 
is to define a double precision literal.

8 Well-known Binary Representation for Geometry 

8.1 Component overview 

The Well-known Binary Representation for Geometry (WKBGeometry) provides a portable representation of a 
geometric object as a contiguous stream of bytes. It permits geometric object to be exchanged between an 
SQL/CLI client and an SQL-implementation in binary form. 

8.2 Component description 

8.2.1 Introduction 

The Well-known Binary Representation for Geometry is obtained by serializing a geometric object as a sequence 
of numeric types drawn from the set {Unsigned Integer, Double} and then serializing each numeric type as 
a sequence of bytes using one of two well defined, standard, binary representations for numeric types (NDR, 
XDR). The specific binary encoding (NDR or XDR) used for a geometry representation is described by a one-byte 
tag that precedes the serialized bytes. The only difference between the two encodings of geometry is one of byte 
order, the XDR encoding is Big Endian, and the NDR encoding is Little Endian. 

8.2.2 Numeric type definitions 

An Unsigned Integer is a 32-bit (4-byte) data type that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range 
[0, 4,294,967,295]. 

A Double is a 64-bit (8-byte) double precision datatype that encodes a double precision number using the IEEE 
754

[18]
 double precision format. 

The above definitions are common to both XDR and NDR.

8.2.3 A common list of codes for geometric types 

In this clause and in other places in this multipart specification, geometric types are identified by integer codes. To 
keep these codes in synchrony and to reserve sections for future use, we define a list here for all geometric object 
types in this specification or planned for future releases. The shaded codes in the table below are for future use 
and do not reflect types used here

8.2.4 XDR (Big Endian) encoding of numeric types 

The XDR representation of an Unsigned Integer is Big Endian (most significant byte first). 

The XDR representation of a Double is Big Endian (sign bit is first byte). 

8.2.5 NDR (Little Endian) encoding of numeric types 

The NDR representation of an Unsigned Integer is Little Endian (least significant byte first). 

The NDR representation of a Double is Little Endian (sign bit is last byte). 

8.2.6 Conversions between the NDR and XDR representations of WKBGeometry 

Conversion between the NDR and XDR data types for Unsigned Integer and Double numbers is a 
simple operation involving reversing the order of bytes within each Unsigned Integer or Double number 
in the representation. 

8.2.7 Relationship to other COM and CORBA data transfer protocols 

The XDR representation for Unsigned Integer and Double numbers described above is also the standard 
representation for Unsigned Integer and for Double number in the CORBA Standard Stream Format for 
Externalized Object Data that is described as part of the CORBA Externalization Service Specification [15]. 



OGC 06-103r3

The NDR representation for Unsigned Integer and Double number described above is also the standard 
representation for Unsigned Integer and for Double number in the DCOM protocols that is based on DCE 
RPC and NDR [16]. 

8.2.8 Description of WKBGeometry representations 

The Well-known Binary Representation for Geometry is described below. The basic building block is the 
representation for a Point, which consists of a number Doubles, depending on the coordinate referece system in 
use for the geometry. The representations for other geometric objects are built using the representations for 
geometric objects that have already been defined.

9 Well-known Text Representation of Spatial Reference Systems 

9.1 Component overview 

The Well-known Text Representation of Spatial Reference Systems provides a standard textual representation for 
spatial reference system information. 

9.2 Component description 

A Spatial Reference System, also referred to as a coordinate system, is a geographic (latitude-longitude), a 
projected (X, Y), or a geocentric (X, Y, Z) coordinate system. 

The coordinate system is composed of several objects. Each object has a keyword in upper case (for example, 
DATUM or UNIT) followed by the defining, comma-delimited, parameters of the object in brackets. Some objects 
are composed of objects so the result is a nested structure. Implementations are free to substitute standard 
brackets ( ) for square brackets [ ] and should be prepared to read both forms of brackets. 

Informative Annex B provides a non-exhaustive list of Geodetic Codes and Parameters for defining the objects in 
the Well-Known Text Representation for spatial reference information.

The Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF) definition for the string representation of a coordinate system is as 
follows, using square brackets. Some definitions for numbers and names are taken from the Geometry WKT.

NOTE: The semi-major axis is measured in meters and shall be> 0. 

NOTE Conversion factor specifies number of meters (for a linear unit) or number of radians (for an angular unit) 
per unit and shall be greater than zero. 

A data set's coordinate system is identified by the PROJCS keyword if the data are in projected coordinates, by 
GEOGCS if in geographic coordinates, or by GEOCCS if in geocentric coordinates. 

The PROJCS keyword is followed by all of the “pieces” which define the projected coordinate system. The first 
piece of any object is always the name. Several objects follow the projected coordinate system name: the 
geographic coordinate system, the map projection, 0 or more parameters, and the linear unit of measure. All 
projected coordinate systems are based upon a geographic coordinate system, so the pieces specific to a 
projected coordinate system shall be described first. 

EXAMPLE 1 UTM zone 10N on the NAD83 datum is defined as 

 PROJCS["NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N", 
  <geographic cs>, 
  PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"], 
  PARAMETER["False_Easting",500000.0], 
  PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0], 
  PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-123.0], 
  PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9996], 



OGC 06-103r3 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 77
 

  PARAMETER["Latitude_of_Origin",0.0], 
  UNIT["Meter",1.0]] 

The name and several objects define the geographic coordinate system object in turn: the datum, the ellipsoid, 
the prime meridian, and the angular unit of measure. 

 

EXAMPLE 2 The geographic coordinate system string for UTM zone 10 on NAD83 is 

 GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983", 
  DATUM["D_North_American_1983", 
  ELLIPSOID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]], 
  PRIMEM["Greenwich",0], 
  UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]] 

EXAMPLE 3 The full string representation of UTM Zone 10N is 

PROJCS["NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_10N", 
 GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983", 
 DATUM[ "D_North_American_1983",ELLIPSOID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],

Annex A 
(informative) 

 
The correspondence of concepts of the common architecture with 

concepts of the geometry model of ISO 19107 

A.1 Introduction 

This informative annex identifies similarities and differences between the geometric concepts this Specification, 
with respect to the geometry model of the ISO 19107. These are referred to throughout this annex as the SFA-CA 
and the Spatial schema, respectively. 

A.2 Geometry model 

A.2.1 Geometry model of SFA-CA 

Figure 1 shows the geometry model and the contents of SFA-CA. For a full detailed description, the interested 
reader is referred to 6.1.

inheritance hierarchy. For a full detailed description, the interested reader is referred to ISO 19107.

A.3 Correspondence 

A.3.1 Overview 

The geometric concepts of the SFA-CA and their respective correspondences to concepts of Spatial schema are 
described as follows. 

⎯ The SFA-CA deals only with at most 2-dimensional geometric objects, whereas the Spatial schema handles 
up to 3-dimensional geometric objects. 

⎯ The Geometry Type of SFA-CA corresponds to the GM_Object of Spatial schema. 

⎯ Individual subtypes of the Geometry Type of SFA-CA correspond to one or more subtypes of the geometry 
model of Spatial schema. 



OGC 06-103r3 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 81
 

⎯ The GeometryCollection type of SFA-CA corresponds to a more restrictive type of the GM_Aggregate of the 
Spatial schema. 

⎯ The concepts of GM_Complex and GM_Composite of the Spatial schema denote the notions of 'manifolds'. 
These notions are not provided by the SFA-CA. 

⎯ The SFA-CA does not support the notions of topology, which is explicitly modelled by the topology model 
provided by the Spatial schema. 

We are only concerned with the second, third and fourth items of the above list when describing the 
correspondences. However, there are some main modelling principles which have to be mentioned. That is, the 
level of abstraction between the SFA-CA and the Spatial schema is a predominant concern throughout this 
correspondence description, and is summarized mainly by the following facts. 

a) SFA-CA is an implementation and platform dependent specification; 

b) Spatial schema is an abstract and non-platform dependent specification. 

Hence, all practical correspondence, e.g., by implementing interoperability, between systems based on the SFA-
CA specification with systems based solely on the Spatial schema specification shall take into account concrete 
representations and concrete data types of the systems. This is especially important when an  
SFA-CA database server should support multiple Spatial-schema-based applications. 

EXAMPLE 1 The x- and y-coordinates in SFA-CA are explicitly defined as of the type Double. In the Spatial schema, the 
corresponding coordinates are only given as of the type Number, i.e., an abstract datatype. 

EXAMPLE 2 All Boolean operations in SFA-CA return “1” when true, otherwise it is interpreted as false, i.e., in either case 
an integer return type. A similar operation in the Spatial schema denotes an explicit Boolean value.  

Finally, attributes of the Spatial schema are abstracts in the sense that they may be given in terms of access and 
mutator operators, or as concrete representational attributes, by an implementation. Details on any of these 
matters are not commented further in this document. 

Most of the correspondences in the following are given on a tabular form, i.e., named concepts and signature 
descriptions of SFA-CA are shown in the first column, and corresponding named concepts and signature 
description of the Spatial schema are given in the second column. Wherever we need to emphasize the 
correspondence, we give a comment in the third column. Hence, we emphasize the correspondence from 
concepts of the SFA-CA to concepts of the Spatial schema, and not the other way around. Thus, SFA-CA needs 
to be contained by the Spatial schema to be regarded as part of the ISO 19100 series of standards. 

A.3.2 Geometry type 

A.3.2.1 Overview 

In most respects the Geometry type of SFA-CA corresponds to the definition of GM_Object of the Spatial schema. 
We pinpoint all the definitions of the Geometry type with the corresponding definitions of the GM_Object type. 
Here we follow the structure of this Specification, and divide the correspondence descriptions into three 
subclauses, given next.

Geometry.SRID ( ):Integer GM_Object::CRS : CRS — 

Geometry.Envelope( ):Geometry GM_Object::envelope(): GM_Envelope 
GM_Object::mbRegion(): GM_Object

Geometry.Boundary( ):Geometry GM_Object::boundary():  
      Set<Reference<GM_Object>> 

The signature changes in the subtypes 
of GM_Object. 

 

A.3.2.3 Methods for testing spatial relations between geometric objects 

In SFA-CA, the set of Egenhofer and Clementini operators is defined directly on the Geometry type. However, in 
the spatial schema, the full set of these operators is not defined as explicit behavioral properties of the GM_Object. 
but as free functions on pairs of geometric or topological objects (ISO 19107, Clause 8). The GM_Object 
implements set operations relations from the interface template (a parameterized classifier in ISO 19107) 
TransfiniteSet<DirectPosition>. Spatial operations can be derived from ISO 19107 from the free functions defined 
in Clause 8: Derived topological relations. 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

Geometry.Equals(anotherGeometry:  
 Geometry):Integer 

GM_Object::equals(pointSet: 
 GM_Object): Boolean 

— 

Geometry.Intersects(anotherGeometry:

GM_Object::intersects(pointSet: 
 GM_Object): Boolean 

Intersects is a derived operator. 

Geometry.Contains(anotherGeometry: 
 Geometry):Integer 

GM_Object::contains(pointSet: 
 GM_Object): Boolean 

— 

 

For the other operators of the Geometry type, i.e., Disjoint, Touches, Crosses, Within, Overlaps and Relate, the 
Spatial schema outlines in ISO 19107:2003 (cf. Clause 8) how to define the corresponding methods in the Spatial 
schema. Note that this outline refers to all three GM_Object, GM_Primitive, and GM_Composite, as the geometric 
object types. The GM_Aggregate type will derive such relations from its respective GM_Primitives type, which 
comprises the element type of an aggregate.

A.3.2.4 Methods that support spatial analysis 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

Geometry.Distance(anotherGeometry: 
  Geometry):Double 

GM_Object::distance(): Distance — 

Geometry.Buffer(distance:Double): 
  Geometry 

GM_Object::buffer(radius: Distance): 
   GM_Object 

Note the difference in 
parameters. 

Geometry.ConvexHull( ):Geometry GM_Object::convexHull(): 
   GM_Object 

— 

Geometry.Intersection(  
 AnotherGeometry:Geometry):Geometry 

GM_Object::Intersection(pointSet: 
  GM_Object): GM_Object 

In principle, this method is used 
to define the spatial relations 
above. 

Geometry.Union(anotherGeometry:  
  Geometry):Geometry 

GM_Object::union(pointSet: 
  GM_Object): GM_Object

  GM_Object): GM_Object 

— 

Geometry.SymDifference(  
 AnotherGeometry:Geometry):Geometry 

GM_Object::symmetricDifference(  
 pointSet: GM_Object): GM_Object 

— 

 

Both the SFA-CA and the Spatial schema sets of set-theoretic (i.e., set-geometric) operations, i.e., the last four 
rows above, explain the semantics in terms of some implicit point-sets. Theoretically, this is correct, but it is not 
verified explicitly that these point-set assumptions are valid for the types of geometric values given by these two 
geometry models. 

A.3.3 “Atomic” subtypes of the Geometry type 

A.3.3.1 Overview 

The structure of the subtype hierarchies of SFA-CA and the Spatial schema above differ in many respects. 
However, this subclause will outline the possible correspondence between the two hierarchies of “atomic” 
subtypes. That is, the term 'atomic subtype' refers to a type which is not a collection, composite, complex, or 
aggregate type. In the following we also include all the operators. 

A.3.3.2 Point 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

Point GM_Point DirectPosition Both alternatives are valid. DirectPosition defines the 
ordinates, i.e., the sequence of numeric coordinates 
denoting a Point. 

Point.X( ):Double GM_Point::position.ordinate[1] 
DirectPosition::ordinate[1] 

Either of these two, depending on the definition of an 
application schema 

Point.Y( ):Double GM_Point::position.ordinate[2] 
DirectPosition::ordinate[2] 

See the previous comment.

A.3.3.3 Curve 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

Curve GM_Curve 
GM_GenericCurve 
GM_CurveSegment 
GM_LineString 
GM_LineSegment 

The notion of a curve in SFA-SQL may correspond to a 
number of definitions in Spatial schema. 

Curve.Length( ):Double GM_GenericCurve::length():Length Operation length is defined with different parameters 
depending on whether the whole or a part of the curve 
length is computed. 

Curve.StartPoint( ):Point GM_GenericCurve::startPoint() : 
 DirectPosition 

— 

Curve.EndPoint( ):Point GM_GenericCurve:: endPoint() : 
 DirectPosition 

— 

Curve.IsClosed( ):Integer GM_Object.isCycle() : Boolean Given by startPoint() = endPoint(); may be similar as 
the GM_Object::isSimple:Boolean 

Curve.IsRing( ):Integer GM_Object.isCycle() : Boolean AND 

GM_Object.isSimple() : Boolean 

Given by both closed and simple properties 

 

A.3.3.4 LineString 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

LineString GM_LineString — 

LinearString.NumPoints( ):Integer GM_LineString::controlPoints.count May be derived 

LinearString.PointN(N:Integer):Point GM_LineString::controlPoints(N) May be derived 

 

A.3.3.5 LinearRing and LineSegment 

These two types are represented as restricted cases of LineString instances in SFA-CA, i.e., both are of type 
LineString with additional constraints. They are non-instantiable types in the SFA-CA, and correspond to 
GM_Ring and GM_LineSegment in the Spatial schema, respectively. Note, however, that the SFA-CA 
implementation specification assumes that a system handles these two types by means of added functionality that 
is not defined by the SFA-SQL. 

A.3.3.6 Surface 

The Surface type of the SFA-CA standard is not an instantiable type. The only surface instantiable by SFA-CA is 
the planer and simple 2D surface given by the Polygon type given in the next subclause.

A.3.3.7 Polygon 

SFA_CA Spatial schema Comment 

Polygon GM_GenericSurface 
GM_Surface 
GM_SurfacePatch 
GM_Polygon 

GM_Polygon and GM_SurfacePatch is not 
shown in Figure A.3, and the 
correspondences in this case are more 
involved, cf. these matters in Reference [1]. 

Surface.Area( ):Double GM_GenericSurface::area() : Area — 

Surface.Centroid( ):Point GM_Object::centroid : DirectPosition — 

Surface.PointOnSurface( ):Point GM_Object:: representativePoint() : 
  DirectPosition 

— 

Polygon.ExteriorRing( ): LineString GM_Polygon::exterior : 
 GM_GenericCurve 

The exterior attribute is defined also as zero 
or more curves in Reference [1]. 

Polygon.InteriorRingN (N:Integer): 
LineString 

Not defined May be calculated, e.g. from the interior 
attribute of GM_Polygon 

Polygon.NumInteriorRing( ):Integer Not defined May be calculated, e.g. from the interior 
attribute of GM_Polygon 

A.3.3.8 PolyhedralSurface 

A PolyhedralSurface is a contiguous collection of polygons, which share common boundary segments and which 
as a unit have the topological attributes of a surface. All surface functions are inherited by PolyhedralSurface.

A.3.4 Collection subtypes of the Geometry type 

A.3.4.1 Overview 

This subclause describes the correspondence between the constructs of collections in SFA-CA and aggregates in 
Spatial schema. The Spatial schema also provides the notions of manifolds, in terms of a structured geometric 
type as a collection of geometric composites, i.e., each composite comprised by composites on a lower level and 
dimension. However, these notions are not supported by SFA-CA and have to handled by other means in an 
SFA-CA based database.

A.3.4.2 GeometryCollection 

This is the root type of other more specialized collection types, which are collections of what we above termed 
atomic geometric types. 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

GeometryCollection GM_Aggregate and its subtype 
GM_MultiPrimitive 

— 

GeometryCollection :: 
NumGeometries( ) : Integer 

GM_Aggregate.element.count : Integer May be calculated as the count of the 
“element” association role of 
GM_Aggregate 

GeometryCollection ::  
GeometryN( N : Integer ) : Geometry 

GM_Aggregate.element.getAt(N) : 
GM_Geometry 

May be calculated, e.g. from the 
“element” association role of 
GM_Aggregate 

 

The subtypes of GeometryCollection, to be presented next, shall ensure the following constraints, which are not 
automatically ensured by aggregates of the Spatial schema. These constraints are summarized as follows. 

a) For every element in a GeometryCollection, its interior shall be disjoint to the interior of every other, but 
distinct element of the same GeometryCollection. 

b) For every boundary of an element in a GeometryCollection, it may only intersect with a boundary of another, 
but distinct element at most in a finite number of points. 

Moreover, the aggregates of the spatial schema referred to below have not defined any explicit methods. It is 
assumed that methods applied to aggregates as geometric objects are derived from existing methods defined for 
the GM_Primitives, which comprises the aggregates. 

A.3.4.3 MultiPoint 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

MultiPoint GM_MultiPoint — 

 

MultiPoint in SFA-CA corresponds to GM_MultiPoint in the Spatial schema. No additional methods are defined for 
MultiPoint. 

A.3.4.4 MultiLineString 

A MultiLineString is a subtype of the non-instantiable type MultiCurve. Note the use of MultiCurve in the 
references to the methods of MultiLineString in the table below. That is, the MultiLineString geometric type does 
not have any methods defined on its own.

GM_MultiLineString 

— 

MultiCurve.IsClosed( ):Integer GM_Object.isCycle() : Boolean May be derived by testing the start and 
end points of every GM_Primitive in the 
aggregate 

MultiCurve.Length( ):Double GM_MultiCurve::length : Length — 

 

A.3.4.5 MultiPolygon 

A MultiPolygon is a subtype of the non-instantiable type MultiSurface. Note the use of MultiSurface in the 
references to the methods of the MultiPolygon in the table below. That is, the MultiPolygon geometric type does 
not have any methods defined on its own. 

SFA-CA Spatial schema Comment 

MultiPolygon GM_MultiSurface This correspondence is unclear and 
precaution should be taken, cf. also the 
correspondence for Polygon above.
