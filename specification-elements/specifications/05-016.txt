5 Terms and definitions


For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply. 

5.1 Abstract Data Type (ADT)


The basic information construct used by the GeoMobility Server and associated Core Services. Consists of well-known data types and structures for location information. Defined as application schemas that are encoded in XML for Location Services (XLS).


5.2 Area of Interest (AOI)


A user defined area (represented by a bounding box, circle or polygon). Often used as a filter in a query.


5.3 (OpenLS) Core Services


The basic services that comprise the open service platform (GeoMobility Server) defined under OpenLS.


5.4 Directory Service


A network-accessible service that provides access to an online directory (e.g. Yellow Pages) to find the location of a specific or nearest place, product or service.

5.5 Gateway Service


A network-accessible service that fetches the position of a known mobile terminal from the network. This interface is modeled after the Mobile Location Protocol (MLP), Standard Location Immediate Service, specified in OMA 3.0 (see Open Mobile Alliance).


5.6 Geocoder Service 


A network-accessible service that transforms a description of a location, such as a place name, street address or postal code, into a normalized description of the location with a Point geometry (see GML Specification for OGC geometry).


5.7 GeoMobility Server


The open service platform comprising the Core Services developed under the OGC OpenLS initiatives.


5.8 Location-Based Service (LBS)


A wireless-IP service that uses geographic information to serve a mobile user. Any application service that exploits the position of a mobile terminal. 


5.9 Navigation Service 


An enhanced version of the Route Service, which is a network-accessible service that determines travel routes and navigation information between two or more points. (This service is documented under separate cover, see section 3.)


5.10 Point of Interest (POI)


A location (with a fixed position) where one can find a place, product or service, typically identified by name rather than by address and characterized by type, which may be used as a reference point or a target in a location based service request, e.g., as the destination of a route.


5.11 Presentation (Map Portrayal) Service 


A network-accessible service that portrays a map made up of a base map derived from any geospatial data and a set of ADT’s as overlays.


5.12 Reverse Geocoder Service


A network-accessible service that transforms a given position into a normalized description of a feature location (Address with Point), where the address may be defined as a street address, intersection address, place name or postal code

. 


5.13 Route Service


A network-accessible service that determines travel routes and navigation information between two or more points. 


5.14 XML for Location Services (XLS)


The method for encoding request/response messages and associated Abstract Data Types for the GeoMobility Server.

7 Top-Level Architecture


Figure 2 shows how the concept GeoMobility Server relates to the other elements of an LBS architecture. The GeoMobility server is an element offering basic functions on which location-based applications are built (the OpenLS Core Services). This server uses open interfaces to access network location capacity (provided through a GMLC, for instance) and provides a set of interfaces allowing applications hosted on this server, or on another server, to access the OpenLS Core Services (see definition of Core Services in section 8). 


The GeoMobility Server also provides content such as maps, routes, addresses, points of interest, traffic, etc. It can also access other local content databases via the Internet. 


In summary, the GeoMobility Server contains:


· The Core Services and their OpenLS interfaces;


· The OpenLS Information Model, consisting of ADTs;


· Possibly, a set of local applications build upon the Core Services and accessing them through OpenLS interfaces;


· Content such as map data, points of interest, routes, and so on used by the Core Services. This content can also be hosted on other servers and accessed through the Internet; and


· Possibly other supporting functions for personalization, context management, billing, logging, etc.

Figure 3. The GeoMobility Server


Note: It is not necessary to specify a Coordinate Reference System for Point geometries that are used by these services because the default for all coordinates used by the GeoMobility Server is WGS 84. The coordinate conventions are as follows: 


- Default Coordinate Reference System - WGS 84 (srsName=EPSG4326);  


- Coordinate Order - Latitude, Longitude; 


- Value Type - Decimal Degrees; 


- Latitude Sign is +90 at North Pole to -90 at South Pole; 


- Longitude Sign is -180 west from Greenwich at the International Dateline to +180 east from Greenwich at the International Dateline.


8.1 Part 1: Directory Service


This service provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the nearest or a specific place, product or service. Through a suitably equipped OpenLS application, the subscriber starts to formulate the search parameters in the service request, identifying the place, product or service that they seek by entering the name, type, category, keyword, phone number, or some other ‘user-friendly’ identifier. A position must also be employed in the request when the subscriber is seeking the nearest place, product or service, or if they desire a place, product or service at a specific location or within a specific area. The position may be the current Mobile Terminal position, as determined through the Gateway Service, or a remote position determined in some other manner. The directory type may also be specified (e.g. yellow pages, restaurant guide, etc). Given the formulated request, the Directory Service searches the appropriate online directory to fulfill the request, finding the nearest or specific place, product or service, depending on the search criteria. The service returns one or more responses to the query (with locations and complete descriptions of the place, product, or service, depending upon directory content), where the responses are in ranked order based upon the search criteria. 


8.1.1 Pinpoint Directory Service


Provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the location of a specific place, product or service. This service is independent of subscriber location (e.g., the subscriber may wish to ‘pinpoint’ a place in a distant country).

8.1.2 Proximity Directory Service


Provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the nearest place, product or service.


From the Usage Scenarios below, it seems unnecessary to separate these usages into two services, when they are simply special cases of the same underlying Directory Service request.


The examples below will illustrate that there are two simple cases for finding a particular point of interest that roughly correspond to the Pinpoint and Proximity requests:


1. By some property of the Point of Interest (e.g., unique identifier, name, description, phone number, absolute location)


2. By its location relative to some other point of interest (e.g., Nearest to me, within some distance of a specified entity, within some defined boundary).


Any of these or combinations of these may be made using the combined Directory Services request which is specified below.


8.1.3 Use Cases


The user of the Directory Service wishes to locate a particular Place, Product or Service.  The user may constrain the request by specifying parameters that filter out candidate places/products/services according to some identifier, attribute, or location.


Example usage scenarios for Directory Service are captured below.


8.1.3.1 Use Case 1


Constraining the request by identifier amounts to a Pinpoint White Pages query: “Where is the Red Dragon Chinese Restaurant?”


8.1.3.2 Use Case 2


Constraining the request just by attribute amounts to a normal Yellow Pages query: “Where are the Chinese Restaurants?”


8.1.3.3 Use Case 3


Constraining the request by location relative to a given location amounts to a Proximity query: “Where is the nearest Chinese Restaurant to my hotel?”


8.1.3.4 Use Case 4


Constraining the request by location within a boundary amounts to a different Proximity query: “Which Chinese Restaurants are within 500m of my hotel?”


Any of these requests could result in a response consisting of a text address list, a location map, or, if a source location is provided with the request, a route map and a list of directions.


8.1.4 Request and Response Parameters for Directory Service


This section specifies the request and response parameters for the Directory Service. Note that it not required to specify a Spatial Reference System as all co-ordinates will be referenced to WGS 84 (latitude, longitude).

8.2 Part 2: Gateway Service


This is the interface between the GeoMobility Server and Location Server that resides in the GMLC or MPC through which OpenLS services obtain position data for Mobile Terminals. This interface is modeled after the MLP specified in OMA 3.0 for Standard Location Immediate Service. 


8.2.1 Use cases


These use cases have been grouped into 3 priority categories, with priority 1 having the highest priority and the only case for mandatory support. 


The Gateway Service should support the following:


		Use Case

		Priority



		Client requests a single mobile terminal’s immediate location.

		1



		Client requests single mobile terminal’s periodic location 

		2



		Client requests multiple mobiles’ immediate location 

		2



		Client requests single mobile terminal’s triggered location

		3



		Client request multiple mobiles’ periodic location

		3



		Client requests multiple mobiles’ triggered location

		3





8.2.2 A Location Request Use Case


A subscriber wants to use a Location-Based Service. The Gateway Service is employed to obtain the position of the subscriber’s mobile terminal from the network. A Location Service Client sends the request to determine a position to the Gateway. The Gateway calculates the position of the subscriber’s mobile terminal and forwards to the Location Service Client, which may store it for as long as needed.

8.3 Part 3: Location Utility Service (Geocode/ Reverse Geocode)


This service performs as a Geocode by determining a geographic position, given a place name, street address or postal code. It also returns a complete, normalized description of the place (which is useful, say, when only partial information is known). The service also performs as a reverse Geocode by determining a complete, normalized place name/street address/postal code, given a geographic position. Both the Geocode and reverse Geocode may return zero, one, or more responses to a service request, depending on subscriber request information, the algorithm being employed, and the match criteria.


8.3.1 Use Cases


8.3.1.1 Geocode Service


Once a Geocode Service determines a position from a partial or complete address, then the pertaining information element becomes a location-based resource that can be readily exploited by another service, like Directory or Route.

8.3.1.1.1 Use Case 1 – Given an Address, Find a Position


A company has a database with a list of its customers and addresses. They want to geocode their database and have a geometry (Point) attached to the addresses. This will then be used to display the locations of customers on a mobile device.


8.3.1.1.2 Use Case 2 – Drive to an Address (Position)


A motorist wishes to drive from home to an address in Regent Street, London. The address is geocoded and its location used as a destination within in a route planning application.


8.3.1.1.3 Use Case 3 – Given a Place/ Street Name, Find its Position and Display it on a Map


Elvis Presley wants a map to his new dwelling place. He only knows part of the address: “Heartbreak Hotel”, ”Lonely Street”.


The partial address is fed into a Geocode Service that determines the complete normalized address and position of Elvis’ dwelling. This in turn is fed into a Route Service that calculates the route from Elvis’ current position (as determined for his cell phone) to the dwelling. The result is a map. 


8.3.1.2 Reverse Geocode Service


8.3.1.2.1 Use Case 1 – Given a Position, Find an Address


The Reverse Geocoding Service is normally requested by an application that merely needs to determine the address for a given position. The application sends a Position ADT to the Reverse Geocode, which returns the Address of the position.

8.3.1.2.2 Use Case 2 – Where am I?


A mobile phone user is walking down a road and wants to know the address of the building that she is standing outside. 


The returned address information returned may be displayed for the subscriber, used to generate a voice command or otherwise used by the OpenLS applications.

8.3.1.2.3 Use Case 3 – Provide Location Context


How “Get Location Service” is provided by the Reverse Geocode Service:

A user needs an answer to the question “Where Am I?” based on their current location. They desire expanded “location context”, e.g., street, place, jurisdiction. The application sends the Position ADT to the Reverse Geocode Service, which returns the expanded location information for that position. The application can then extract the location information corresponding to the required context “street address”, “place” etc. 


8.3.2 Request and Response Parameters


This section specifies the primary request and response parameters for the Geocode and Reverse Geocode Services. 


8.3.2.1 Geocode Service


		Primary GeocodeRequest Parameters



		A collection of one or more of the parameters below.



		Name

		Mandatory?

		Data Type

		Description



		Address

		Y

		Address ADTs

		List of 1(( Addresses. May be unstructured free form address, partial or complete addresses. 



		Primary GeocodeResponse Parameters



		For each Address request, the response (GeocodeResponseList) will contain a collection of the following parameters: 



		Name

		Mandatory?

		Data Type

		Description



		numberOfAddresses (attribute of GeocodeResponseList)

		Y

		Integer (non-negative)

		Number of valid responses (GeocodedAddress) found by the Geocoder Service for a given Address request; may be zero.



		List of 1(( GeocodedAddress(es) sorted by the Accuracy of the match, with highest accuracy first, each with the following parameters: 



		Point

		Y

		Point (Geometry)

		The position of the GeocodedAddress response resulting from the geocoding operation. 



		Address

		Y

		Address ADT

		The actual Address for the GeocodedAddress response. These are normalised addresses.



		GeocodeMatchCode

		N

		GeocodingQOSType 

		The QoS information for the GeocodedAddress response. Provides information on the quality of the match. These results consist of an Accuracy (float value within the range 0.0 – 1.0) and a MatchCode (MatchType)





8.3.2.2 Reverse Geocode Service


		Primary ReverseGeocodeRequest Parameters



		Name

		Mandatory?

		Data Type

		Description



		Position

		Y

		Position ADT

		The starting position (lat,long)  for Reverse Geocoder. 



		ReverseGeocodePreference








		N

		ReverseGeocodePreferenceType

		Describes the preference for the response from the Reverse Geocoder Service: StreetAddress, IntersectionAddress, or PositionOfInterest (Place and/or PostalCode). If not specified, then the service will return the nearest StreetAddress.



		Primary ReverseGeocodeResponse Parameters



		Name

		Mandatory?

		Data Type

		Description



		List of 0(( ReverseGeocodedLocation(s) sorted by the SearchCentreDistance (the distance between the starting Position in the request and each Point-Address response), in order (with shortest distance first), where each ReverseGeocodedLocation has the following parameters: 



		Address

		Y

		Address ADT

		The actual Address for the ReverseGeocodedLocation response. These are normalised addresses.



		Point

		Y

		Point (geometry)

		The position (lat, long) of the ReverseGeocodedLocation response.



		SearchCentreDistance

		N

		Float (decimal metres)

		Distance of Point from starting Position.





Notes:


1. SearchArea must contain starting Position; therefore the service must be capable of validating this.


2. All response lists are sorted in order of shortest to longest SearchCentreDistance (default in metres).


3. If SearchArea is not specified, only the nearest valid response is returned.


8.4 Part 4: Presentation Service 


This service renders geographic information for display on a Mobile Terminal. Any OpenLS Application may call upon this service to obtain a map of a desired area, with or without map overlays that depict one or more OpenLS ADTs, such as Route Geometry, Point of Interest, Area of Interest, Location, Position and/or Address. The service may also be employed to render route directions from Route Maneuver List ADT and/or Route Instructions List ADT. 


8.4.1.1 Output Parameters 


Defines what the size and encoding of the portrayed map should be using the following criteria:


· Width – The width of the map in pixels.


· Height – The height of the map in pixels.


· Format – Parameter that specifies what the encoding of the map should be.  This is specified as a mime-type.  The mime-types supported are left up to the implementation.


· Transparency - Boolean that defines the opacity of the background of the map.


· Background Color – Defines the background color of a map if it is opaque.


· Content – Specifies what type of content would be returned, whether the URL or the data as base64


The default behavior of the map is to return the exact image size as specified in the request. The Harmonization group is working on harmonizing the different specifications like WMS and OpenLS, to have consistent behavior where both specs are concerned. 


8.4.1.2 Context 


Defines what area of the world the map is portraying.  This can be defined in the following ways:


· Bounding Box- Two-point box in a specific SRS that defines the extents of the map (WGS 84 is the default).  This is the same bounding box used in WMS and is present for compatibility with it.


· Center Point and Scale - The center point defines the center of your map at a particular scale and projection.  

· Center Point – The center point of the map.  This point is specified in WGS 84 as a latitude/longitude in decimal format.

· Scale – The ratio between device units and world units.  Specified as the number of world units per device units.  Thus 1:50000 would be expressed as a scale of 50000.

· Azimuth – The orientation of the map.  This is expressed in clockwise degrees from north.


· DPI – Dots per inch of the device.  


· SRS – Spatial Reference System.  Provides what projection should be used when creating the map.


· DisplayScale - A ratio of distance.  For example 1:5000 would be expressed as 5000, it's always expressed per 1 pixel of the display.

If context is not specified the implementation must derive it from the ADTs.


8.4.1.3 Overlays 


Defines a list of ADTs for portrayal on the map.


· ADT (Abstract Data Type)  – ADTs are usually obtained as outputs from other core services.  To date we have Position ADT, Route ADT, POI ADT and Map ADT.


· Z Order – The order in which the ADTs are laid on top of each other over the base map. 


· Custom Style – This is either a named-style or a user-defined style. This specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future versions to define.


 If a style is not specified it is up to the implementation to use a default.


8.4.1.4 Base Map 

Provides a backdrop for the ADTs and is made up of a set of layers.  The user determines the layers that are to be included or excluded from the base map in their request. The implementation must create and support its own list of layers for the user to choose from.  


· Layers – The list of layers of interest


· Filter – Determines if the layers are included or excluded. “Give me only the following layers” or “Give me all layers but the following”. The default behavior is to include all the layers. But when filters need to be applied that’s when they would need to be defined.


· Custom Style – This is either a named-style or a user-defined style. This specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future versions to define.


If a style is not specified it is up to the Implementation to use a default.


8.4.1.5 Style 

Defines how the ADTs should look. The implementation should create and support their own list of styles for the consumer to choose from.


· Named Style – A string that is provided by the implementation.


· User Defined Style – The consumer defines the content of the style. This specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future versions to define.


8.4.1.6 Get Capabilities

Provides the user with the list of capabilities that the implementation provides.  Consists of the following:


· Layers - Layers provided by the implementation. 


· Style – Styles provided by the implementation.


· Format – Mime-types supported by the implementation.

· SRS – Spatial Reference Systems supported, in EPSG:XXXX format.

8.4.2 Use Cases


8.4.2.1 Use Case 1


Joe User wants to see where his house is located on a map. To satisfy this use case the presentation service needs to show a base map with the position of Joe’s house overlaid onto it.


For an example see section 8.4.4.1.


8.4.2.2 Use Case 2




Planning a family road trip, Joe User wants to see how get from his house in Calgary, Alberta, to the hotel he has booked in San Diego, California.  To satisfy this use case the presentation service needs to show map(s) with the route and the two points of interest overlaid onto it.   


For an example see section 8.4.4.2.

The following are examples of one way to solve the use cases defined in Section 8; they are not the only solutions.


8.4.4.1 Use Case 1 Example


In order to satisfy Use Case 1, the application must acquire a Position ADT for where Joe’s home is located.  One way to do this is to have the Geocoder Service geocode his address, thus determining a Position ADT.


In this example we are asking for:

8.4.4.2 Use Case 2 Example


A prerequisite for this use case are Position ADTs for Joe’s home and the Hotel.  We also need the Route ADT, which shows the route from the home to the hotel. The Route ADT may be obtained from the Route Service.


Because the route is very large and we want to see it at a detailed scale we will be asking for multiple maps.


We are asking for:


· (N) maps centered on different points of the route


· 640x480 image in PNG format


· At a scale of 1:80000


· In UTM projection


· With a north orientation


· Base map will consist of only the road network and landmarks

8.5 Part 5: Route Service 


This service determines a route for a subscriber. The subscriber must use a navigation application to set up the use of the service. They must indicate the start point (usually the position acquired through the Gateway Service, but this could be a planned trip from a specified location, say, from their home), and the endpoint (any location, like a place for which they only have the phone number or an address, or a place acquired through a search to a Directory Service). The subscriber may optionally specify waypoints, in some manner, the route preference (fastest, shortest, least traffic, most scenic, etc.), and the preferred mode of transport. The subscriber may optionally store a route for as long as needed, thus requiring the means to also fetch a stored route.


An enhanced version of this service, the Navigation Service, is described under separate cover (see Normative References, section 3). The Navigation Service supports the same parameters as the Route Service, plus additional parameters for navigation purposes. 


9.5.2 Use Cases


Use Case 1: The user wants to know: Which route should I take? The user has specified the endpoints, and optionally some waypoints, in some manner, or these points have been specified for the user. The starting point is either defined from a GPS or cellular network measurement or entered manually by the user. This information is then fed to a service that determines the route. Optionally, the user may specify route determination criteria. These criteria might be: fastest, shortest, least traffic, most scenic, etc. and can also specify the preferred mode of transport of the user. The routing algorithm might default to a single criterion, such as fastest. The route can also be optionally stored on the terminal or application server. The user may store it for as long as needed, thus requiring the means to also fetch a stored route.

10 General Use Cases


Use Case I. A subscriber wants to access a list of restaurants nearby its location. He/she does not have any positioning capabilities on his/her device. The position of the subscriber is provided by network elements (GMLC/MPC). 


The following sequence of events take place:


· A subscriber accesses the telecom operator portal via the wireless network;


· The portal identifies the service requested by the subscriber and directs the request to a ‘Restaurant Guide’ application running on the GeoMobility Server; this application can also be hosted on a 3rd party server;


· The requested service sends a request to a GMLC to get the position of the subscriber’s Mobile Terminal;


· The GMLC provides an estimation of the Mobile Terminal position;


· Knowing the subscriber position, the ‘Restaurant Guide’ application sends a request, including the returned Mobile Terminal position in the form of a Position ADT, to a Directory Service that returns a list of restaurants within a certain radius around the estimated subscriber position;


· The list of restaurants is sent back to the subscriber;


· An application running on the Mobile Terminal allows the subscriber to view and interact with the list. [The next actions the subscriber is likely to take are to select a restaurant from the list and then ask for the directions and route map to assist them in driving from where they are to the chosen restaurant.]


An example of sequence for a service request is illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 8. A Typical Service Request/Response


The MLP defined by OMA (formerly LIF) is used to access GMLC/MPC positioning information. GMS resources are accessed through OpenLS APIs.


11 Architecture Details


The Operator’s Portal likely hosts the following functions:


1. Front-end functions to support session management, authentication of the subscribers, requests handling, etc. This box can also be a simple relay, transferring requests for services from subscribers to 3rd party applications.


2. LBS support functions for billing, privacy management and roaming. 


3. A Service Platform hosting different applications (including proxies to OpenLS Applications that run on the GMS) and various supporting functions to support personalization, context management, etc. The service platform may also access a Location Server through the Gateway Service (based upon OMA 3.0). 


4. Optionally, the Service Platform may host OpenLS Applications like ‘Personal Navigator’ and ‘Concierge’.


The GMS hosts the following functions:


1. Possibly, OpenLS Applications, like ‘Personal Navigator’ and ‘Concierge’. These applications access OpenLS Core Services through their APIs. They are the consumers of OpenLS ADTs.


2. OpenLS Core Services (Route, Location Utility, Directory, Presentation, and Gateway). These services are accessible through OpenLS APIs, as defined in the specifications. They in turn access the location content needed to perform their functions.


3. Location Content Databases.  Contain any map data, route networks, address data navigation support data, and directories with any place, product or service information. Accessed through OGC Interfaces (Web Feature Server, Web Map Server, Web Coverage Server) or other interfaces, depending on implementation requirements. [More specification work is planned here in future test beds.]


4. OpenLS Applications and Core Services can also access other GMSs and location content databases hosted by 3rd parties.


The following figure highlights the functional roles of the Portal, Service Platform, GMS, GMLC/MPC, and 3rd party platforms.


12 General Features


· The “lang” attribute of the XLS element may be used to specify a preferred language for formatting responses.  For example, this attribute may be used to request that route instructions be returned in alternate languages from the Route Service. Valid values for the xls:lang attribute are defined in XML 1.0 ( which references IETF RFC 1766, which inturn are constructed from two-letter language code defined by ISO 639 and from two-letter country codes as defined by ISO 3166).  For example:  en-GB, en-US, fr


· srsName attribute of the XLS element may be used to specify the preferred coordinate system to process the request, and return the response in, if supported by the server.

13 Conformance Requirements and Procedures


Conformance and Testing for this Implementation Specification must be based upon the normative schema in Annex A. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance, are specified in ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing. 


The sponsors of this specification have devised a conformance test requirements and procedures to be defined in a separate document

14 Future Work


14.1 OpenLS 1.0


This specification is the result of nearly two years of effort and 
implementation testing. Considerable effort has been invested in harmonizing 
this specification suite with other OGC specifications, particularly GML 
3.0, and OMA specifications, particularly OMA 3.0. It is the view of the 
submitters that the results of these harmonization efforts are adequate and 
sufficient, based upon the requirements defined in this document and the 
results of implementation and test activities. The submitters recognize that 
this harmonization process must continue so that every attempt is made to 
satisfy the needs of the market, to address the feedback received from 
implementers and other OGC members, and to remain consistent with evolving 
OGC and OMA specifications. 

14.2 OpenLS 1.1


The release of OpenLS 1.1 was meant to offer some fixes to the service schema. No major changes were intended. Changes that might affect the way the services work, will be addressed for a release of OpenLS 2.0. Also, the group has invested considerable time to address the need for a conformance test and work on providing it soon.

<documentation> We need to look more closely at this choice block (it's too restrictive).

Also, clients have no way to specify which of these information types they want returned (ReferenceSystem, POIInfoList, Point, and/or Address), like we do for GeoCode. Plus, when a Directory Service has two or more of these types, with the choice block there is no way for the a client to receive the full information set. Do we want to change this to a sequence block and/or change POIAttributeList and/or Point to optional? Also, we need to examine the role of POI in this form since it may not return a Point or Address and therefore may not have sufficient info to be used in location services that require a position of some sort.

<documentation>


The AddressType is the Address_ADT for OpenLS and it supports the concepts of the OGC Geocoder document 01-026r1



with some modifications which resulted in both simplifications and improved handling capability.  The definition is also



broad enough to handle some of the more obscure occurrences of street addressing as well as handling the



case of when all you have is an un-parsed string representing the complete address.  We could generalize this even



further to handle non-street addressing schemes found in other industries, such as the Municipal Survey Addressing



schemes that are used by Municipalities to address the lots on which a building may be placed but that is probably a



future requirement outside the scope of OLS1.

Annex A.2: OpenGIS( Location Services (OpenLS) Requirements (Informative)


1 Requirements


1.1 Terminology


The key words “must”, “should” and “may” are to be interpreted in the detailed requirements as follows:


Must—The item is an absolute requirement of the specification.


Should— There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore the item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different approach.


May—The item will be considered, but further examination is needed to determine if the item should be treated as a requirements.


Note that only the Italic versions of these terms are to be interpreted as above. 


1.2 General Requirements

Note: These requirements were taken from the document entitled: “XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements”, dated 15 Apr 2002, v1.1, and supersede that document.


These requirements pertain to the exchange of location information for the GeoMobility Server, an open location services platform. As such, these requirements reflect the character and nature of location information exchange for the OpenLS Core Services.  The following sponsor observations led to these requirements:

· The location services market demands technology that subscribes to the principal of simplicity so that these services will be widely adopted throughout the wireless-IP realm. The objective is to shield the wireless provider from “GIS complexity”. We are driven by the desire to hit the mainstream with simple, essential, widely adopted capabilities. Also, one size does not necessarily fit all. Consider these technologies that have emerged for wireless IP:


· Java: J2ME


· SVG: Mobile SVG


· kDom and kXML (kxml.enhydra.org)


· Small form factor mobile terminals with limited memory, power, and processing resources and limited bandwidth demands lightweight solutions for location information exchange. Devices widely available in the market could be classified into three general classes. 


· Class A - Devices with very limited capabilities like pagers and cell phones 


· Class B - Devices with moderate capabilities like Palm OS PDA 


· Class C - Devices with relatively good capabilities like Windows CE devices 


· Current network capabilities are very limited in bandwidth. Bandwidth available for devices ranges between 9.6 Kbps and 28.8 Kbps in general


· Next generation devices will be smarter and therefore will accept location information for limited onboard processing.


· Back-end server traffic is also a concern. Messages should be as compact as possible.


        1.2.1 Usage Scenarios


The usage scenarios for XLS are captured in the use cases for the OpenLS Core Services (see references in section 3).   These use cases define the general scope of XLS. 


1.2.2 Design Guidelines


The following design guidelines were considered for XLS. They are based on participants’ experience in both the wireless community and with the OGC process.  They constitute general design guidance toward achieving OpenLS objectives.


1.2.2.1 General Guidelines


1) XLS must be based on current market conditions in terms of available technology, content and industry standards.


2) XLS should be simple and sufficient. This means that it should be able to adequately represent geographic objects for location services with minimum overhead and complexity (i.e., easy to encode and decode). As such, XLS must implement the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS. These types must be extensible. 


3) XLS should have small footprint (compact for transmission to low powered mobile terminals with limited memory). 


4) XLS should be developed such that it can be implemented in J2ME based platforms, and accessible by kDom and kXML APIs, with their current capabilities and maybe other wireless platforms that may emerge.


5) A single profile of XLS may be insufficient to deal with the variety of mobile devices. (For example, Mobile SVG will have two profiles: SVG-Basic and SVG-Tiny). Similarly, XLS may exist in two profiles that correspond to different classes of devices. In this case an appropriate capabilities discovery scheme should be devised to allow clients to discover which profiles are supported by the server 


1.2.2.2 Compatible, Consistent and Extensible


1) XLS should be scalable so that it can support a wide variety of devices, users, and applications.


2) A simple data model should support XLS for all Abstract Data Types. This will minimize the overhead for feature (object) construction and deconstruction for OpenLS applications and services.


3) XLS should be defined in XML schema (xsd).


4) XLS types should be defined in a way that would give them enough flexibility to be used according to SOAP encoding rules.


5) XLS specification activities should be harmonized with ISO 19133 (Navigation), ISO 19118 (XML Encoding rules) and GML. 


6) XLS should be designed so that XLS instances can be transformed (e.g., through an XSLT stylesheet) into GML. 


7) An appropriate versioning scheme should be devised to guarantee clear versioning numbers. 


1.2.3 Detailed Requirements


1.2.3.1 General


1) XLS must be based upon well-defined Abstract Data Types for OpenLS.


2) Similar to GML, XLS should maintain the separation between location information content and presentation. XLS can be directly rendered on the mobile device or through a standard technology like Mobile SVG. (Current parsers for the devices do not have XSLT support.)


1.2.3.2 Encoding


1) XLS must encode the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS in a compact form. The effort to keep the model simple goes hand-in-hand with the need to avoid the overhead of unnecessary encoding, decoding and feature construction/deconstruction complexity for users of OpenLS services.


2) XLS should use short tags.


3) XLS may use a minimum tag set that is sufficient to meet the encoding requirements for the OpenLS Abstract Data Types.


4) XLS may include binary encodings.


5) XLS should avoid multiple levels of nesting. (Keep the depth of the trees shallow for simplicity and to minimize the size of code written to handle it. This helps to keep the applications installed on wireless devices as small in size as possible.) 


1.2.3.3 Properties


1) XLS must support the properties required for Abstract Data Types for OpenLS.


2) Properties must be simple properties. Multiple nesting levels should be avoided in properties to avoid complexity.


1.2.3.4 Metadata


1) XLS should support metadata.  


1.2.3.5 Geometry Elements


1) XLS must include point, line, line-string and polygon geometries, per OGC Simple Feature Model. 


2) XLS may include other geometries.



1.2.3.6 XLS Feature Relationship Schema


1) XLS may use Xlink to reference local resources or remote resources in the same document only, in an appropriate way that would work with the limited capabilities of available parsers.


2) XLS must support simple relationships in which relationships do not carry properties. 


1.2.3.7 XLS Feature Schema


1) XLS should support a simplified feature model that doesn’t require multiple nesting levels.


2) XLS must support the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS and related operations.


1.3 Interface Envelop and Encoding Requirements

This section outlines the requirements pertaining to the encoding of the interfaces (i.e., the Request and Response Parameters) for OpenLS Core Services.


1.3.1 Key Concepts


a) A Client Application is any application that interacts with Core Services, whether it resides on an end-user device or on a server. 


b) A Request is the XML string that is passed from a Client Application to a Core Service.


c) A Response is the XML string that is passed from a Core Service to the Client Application. 


d) A Session is a series of interactions between a Client Application and one or more Core Services. Those interactions are typically in the form of series of Requests and Responses. 

e) Well-Known Request Type and Well-known Response Type are Types that are known to both Client Applications and Core Services.


f) In this document we refer to the ‘Request and Response pair’ for a Core Service as: R/R.


1.3.2 General Usage Pattern 


Figure 9 illustrates the general usage pattern for XML based R/R in OpenLS. The use case starts with the execution of a Client Application that processes a user’s request for service. This in turn leads to a request for the use of a Core Service, e.g., a Directory Service.  The Client Application encodes the request for the Core Service as an XML Request. Using the HTTP/Post method, the XML Request is sent to a Servlet. The Servlet parses the XML Request, and according to the Request tags, generates the proper function call to the Core Service. The Core Service processes the Request and sends back the Response to the Servlet. The Servlet in turn encodes the Response as an XML Response and forwards it to the Client Application. The Client Application in turn decodes the XML Response and applies the proper presentation functions for display on the Client Device. In the case of thin Client Devices, it is possible that parsing of the XML Response is done on the server and the portrayal content is streamed directly to the Client Device.

Figure 9. Usage Pattern for OpenLS Request/Response Pairs


1.3.3 Assumptions


1) The architecture is based on connectionless protocol. A Client Application may establish a connection for making a Request, and disconnect right after a Response has arrived. 


2) The Client Application knows the Request URI for the OpenLS Core Service. This includes the Port Number.


3) Client Applications are aware of all Interfaces that the Core Service exposes.


4) The Core Service can parse and understand the semantics of the XML Request Parameters generated by the Client Application.


5) Core Services know all the mandatory and optional Request Parameters generated by Client Applications.


6) Client Applications can parse and understand the semantics of the XML Response Parameters generated by Core Services.


7) Client Applications know all mandatory Response Parameters, and possibly some, all, or none of the optional Response Parameters generated by Core Services. If an optional parameter is sent to a Client Application, it is then assumed that the Client Application can understand it; otherwise the Client Application generates an error message or ignores this optional Response Parameter.


1.3.4 General Requirements


The following requirements pertain to both Request and Response Schemas:


1) The R/R schemas must be based on XML Schema, re: W3C Recommendation (2 May 2001).


2) Encoded ADT-based R/R Parameters in XML must be consistent with the encoding guidelines and requirements as stipulated in the latest version of the XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements (section 0). 


3) R/R pairs must be consistent with the XLS ADTs.


4) R/R Pairs must be Well-Known Types. 


5) Upon receiving a Request from a Client Application, a Core Service must send at least one Well-Known Response to the Client Application. A Response might be an answer to the Request, an error message, or an acknowledgement of receiving the Request.


6) XML R/R instances must be well formed and valid with respect to their schemas. 


1.3.5 Encoding Requirements


1.3.5.1 Naming


1) If applicable, you should satisfy encoding name conventions as stipulated in the latest version of the XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements (section 0).


2) You should use English descriptors that accurately describe the attribute/element/type, etc. For example, use names like firstName, grandTotal, or CorporateCustomer. Although names like x1, y1, or fn are easy to type because they’re short, they do not provide any indication of what they represent and result in schemas that are difficult to understand, maintain, and enhance. 


3) Be consistent in using terminology. You should use terminology that applies for the application domain. For example, if you create an element MobileDevice and the mobile operators call it MobileTerminal, use the latter. 


4) You should use avoid long names. Some standards recommend a maximum of 13 characters and some 15 characters. For OpenLS, try to limit names to 15 characters in length. 


5) Do your best to avoid the use of abbreviations. If you must use an abbreviation, then be consistent with its use. For example, if you want to use a short form for the word “number”, then you should use something like ‘nbr’ or ‘num’  (it doesn’t really matter what form you use), but be consistent in its use.


6) You should avoid names that are similar or differ only in case. For example Name and name. This aids interpretability of the schema. 


7) You should avoid names that only differ in their plurality. For example, the attribute names mobileTerminal and mobileTerminals should not be used together.


8) In general, you should use lower case letters, but capitalize the first letter of element names, enumerations and type names. You should use all lower case for attribute names, unless you are using a compound name (see the next requirement). 


9) You should use mixed case to make compound names more readable. Specifically, you should use upper case for the first letter in all but the first word of a compound Attribute name (e.g., attributeName), or upper case for the first letter of all words comprising a compound element name, type name or enumeration (e.g. ElementName).

10) Abstract Types should use the keyword ‘Abstract’ in their name. For example, an Abstract Type for Device might be represented as: AbstractDeviceType.


11) You should use an underscore (i.e. ‘_’) to prefix abstract element names (e.g., _Device). 


12) You should avoid the use of acronyms. If you find it necessary to use an acronym, you should capitalize all letters. For example, using the acronym ‘GIS’, use GISAttribute for an attribute and GISObject for an element. 


1.3.5.2 Structures


1) If possible, you should use Attributes instead of Elements. You should use Attributes if they are simple types and have cardinality = 1, at most.


2) You should avoid using Anonymous Types. Named types allow reuse.


3) You should avoid using the same local Element name for different types. 


4) You must use “sequence” blocks instead of “all” blocks within “ComplexType”. Complex types that contain "all" blocks cannot be legally subtyped. 


5) You should avoid Anonymous “choice” Blocks.


6) You should only declare List types when necessary. 


7) You should avoid unsignedInt, unsignedByte, unsignedLong, and unsignedShort and use facets instead when you need to restrict the domain.


1.3.5.3 Coordinate Systems and Units of Measure


1) You should use degrees as the default units of measure for angles.


2) You should use meters as the default units of measure for distances and coordinates. 


3) You should express azimuth in degrees measured clockwise from true north.


4) You should use WGS 84 as the default datum and Coordinate Reference System.


5) You should follow the OGC recommendation for Coordinate Reference Systems (SRS). 


6) You should follow the OGC recommendation for Units of Measure.


1.3.5.4 Name Spaces


1) All schemas generated under the OpenLS initiative must set the targetNameSpace attribute value to: http://www.opengis.net/xls.


1.3.6 Request Requirements


Each OpenLS Core Service shall have an XML Request Packet that contains the Request. The XML Request Packet must include at least two main Blocks
, a Header Block and one or more Method Blocks (which will contain the actual requests): 


1) Request Header Block


 a) A Request Header Block should contain the username and password for the Client Application. 


 b) A Request Header Block should contain the type of the client device, if applicable (based upon a well-known list of known types). 


 c) A Request Header Block may contain a client-defined Session Identifier, to be echoed back by the server.


2) Request Method Block(s)


 a) An XML Request should contain zero or more Method Blocks. 


 b) A Request Method Block must contain a “global” unique method name (Type NMT) that identifies the method that will be invoked by the Core Service. The term “global” refers to a unique ID that identifies a method in the context of the applicable OpenLS Core Service. 


 c) A Request Method Block must contain Request Version, which indicates the version of the Request that it supports. 


 d) A Request Method Block must contain Response Version, which indicates the version of the Response that the Client Application supports.


 e) A Request Method Block must contain a maximum of one Sub-Block that contains the XML payload (the request parameters) for the specified method. 


 f) Each Request Method Block must have a Request Identifier. The Request Identifier is a string that must appear in the Method Request Tag as an ‘ID’ attribute. A Request Identifier must be unique within the scope of a session. 


1.3.7 Response Requirements


The XML Response Packet must include at least two main Blocks, a Header Block and one or more Response Method Blocks: 


1) Response Header Block


 a) A Header Block may include the status of the Response (use a standard list of enumerations for status -- TBD).


 b) A Header Block should contain a Session Identifier, which corresponds with the applicable Request Session Identifier.


Note: The error list associated with the Header Block is for authentication errors and other errors generated for the envelop, whereas error lists associated with a Response Method Block are for individual responses.


2) Response Method Block(s)


 a) An XML Response must contain at least one Response Method Block. 


 b) The Response Method Block must contain zero or one Sub-Blocks that contain the XML payload for the specified method. 


 c) A Response Method Block must contain Response Version, which indicates the version used to encode the Response.


 d) A Response Method Block may include the status of the Method Response (use a standard list of enumerations for status -- TBD).


 e) A Response Method Block may include zero or more Fault (Error) Elements, which indicate the error status (use a standard enumerated list of errors -- TBD), code and description generated during the scope of the session. [Note: Error handling is based upon the SOAP Fault Element.]


 f) Response Packets may have the same identifier as the Method Request Tag. The ‘ID’ is a must if this method employs a Request Identifier, and it must match the Request Identifier. Having more than one Response Method Block is usually a result of sending more than one Request Method Block.


1.3.8 HTTP Transaction Protocol Requirements


1.3.8.1 HTTP Request Requirements


1) OpenLS Core Services must conform to HTTP/1.1 Post Request according to IETF RFC 2616. 


2) HTTP/1.1 Post Requests must contain Two Blocks. The first Block must be the header that conforms to HTTP/1.1. The second Block, the body, must contain the content payload of the Request.

 a) Must include the Content-Length.


 b) Must include the Content-Type. For the purpose of this test bed, the Content-Type must be text/xml.


 c) Must contain CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed).


4) HTTP/1.1 Post Request Body Block


 a) The Request Block must include the XML payload of the Request.

<InputMsInformation msIdType="msisdn" msIDValue=”



+12066741000”/>


  



</InputMSIDS>




</InputGatewayParameters>


 
</SLIR>

</gml:Point>








</Position>







</MSInformation>


  



</MSIDS>





</GatewayParameters>




</SLIA>


1.4 Abstract Data Type Requirements


The ADTs are well-known information types that are used by the Core Services, and form the Information Framework for the GeoMobility Server. 


1.4.1 Address ADT 


Address ADT contains address information for a geographic place. Addresses reference and uniquely identify particular points of interest and can serve as the basis for aggregating data for that location. The Address ADT consists of a street address (or intersection), place name (e.g. country, municipality, etc.), postal code, street locator, building locator, and supplemental address information. As used here, addresses are the means of referencing primarily residences and buildings (of all types, where a subscriber may conduct business).


1.4.2 Area of Interest (AOI) ADT 


Contains an Area of Interest as defined by a named circle, bounding box, or polygon. Used to as a search parameter or can be displayed for a subscriber (e.g. Hot Zone).


1.4.3 Location ADT 


The extensible, abstract type for all expressions of Location that can be used by OpenLS application and services to specify the location of a target or a subscriber. Location is the root of a semantic tree that includes a Point, Position ADT, Address ADT, and POI ADT as its subtypes. 


1.4.4 Map ADT 


Map ADT contains a rendered map that results from the Map Portrayal Operation of the Presentation Service. It can then be used as input to other Presentation Services.  Map ADT consists of content information (format, width and height) and context information (bounding box, center point and scale).


1.4.5 Point of Interest (POI) ADT 


A place or entity with a fixed position that may be used as a reference point or a target in an OpenLS service. The POI is the primary output from a Directory Service, and thus, is also the “place” where one might obtain a product or service. It contains name, type, category, address, phone number, and other directory information about the place, product, and/or service.


1.4.6 Position ADT 


Position ADT contains any observed or calculated position, in the broad semantic context of the use of the term. It primarily contains a geographic position and quality of position. Position is the primary output from a Gateway Service. Position maps to the semantics of the Location, Shape and Quality of Position elements, as defined in the Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) Specification (Version 3.0, OMA). Thus, it contains the full definition of a position of a Mobile Terminal (Standard Location Immediate Service). Position may also be used by an OpenLS application to represent any position of interest. Position is distinguished from POI, which is a well-known place with a position, name, address, etc. 


1.4.7 Route Instructions List ADT 


Route Instructions List ADT contains a list of travel instructions consisting of turn-by-turn directions and advisories along the route, ordered in sequence of their occurrence, and formatted for presentation to the user. Route Instructions List ADT is generated by the Route Service and “presented” to a subscriber via the Presentation Service.


1.4.8 Route ADT 


The Route ADT is actually two ADTs: Route Summary and Route Geometry. Route Summary contains the route’s overall characteristics, such as its start point, waypoints, end point, transportation type, total distance, travel time, and bounding box. Route Geometry contains a list of geographic positions along the route, ordered in the sequence of planned travel, starting with the position of the route’s origin and ending with the position of the route’s destination. The geometry includes the positions of all nodes along the route, including waypoints. The geometry also includes intermediate points needed to describe the geometric shape of the route segments between each node in the route. These two ADTs are generated by the Route Service and “presented” to a subscriber as routing information, e.g. as a route displayed over a map, via the Presentation Service, or they are used directly by an application to guide a mobile subscriber to their destination.


1.5 Service Requirements


1.5.1 Directory Service requirements


1.5.1.1 General


The definition of request/response pairs defined below will encompass the requirements for both Pinpoint and Proximity Directory Services.  The two usages of the Directory Service will be affected by selecting the appropriate optional parameters in the XML schema.


1.5.1.2 Request Requirements


The parameters of the combined Pinpoint/Proximity request must include:


· Directory Type: e.g., White Pages, Yellow Pages, Green Pages, etc.


The Pinpoint query will use parameters that will uniquely identify the Point of Interest.


At least one of the following options may be used to identify the target location:


· Point of Interest Name, identifying a specific location – e.g., Red Dragon Chinese Restaurant;


· Point of Interest Point, identifying an exact location coordinate of the Point of Interest;


· Point of Interest Address, identifying the street address of the Point of Interest.


The Proximity query will use parameters that will identify a shortlist of candidate locations by distance from a location that may itself be specified by a Pinpoint query, e.g., “Give me the taxi rank nearest to the Red Dragon Chinese Restaurant”.


This may involve a combination of Proximity parameters to spatially constrain the search:


· Proximity Type: type of proximity algorithm – e.g., Linear Distance, Bounding Polygon;


· Source Location – point for determining proximity (possibly a POI);


· Proximity Minimum Distance;


· Proximity Maximum Distance;


· Proximity WithinBoundary, a polygon for Bounding Polygon search;


It will also involve a combination of parameters to constrain the result of the search:


· Maximum Number of elements to be returned: e.g., nearest 5 restaurants.


· Sort criteria (attribute to sort on; ascending/descending).


Other parameters may be used to constrain the search, resulting in a shortlist of Points of Interest:


· List of Point of Interest Place/Product/Service types identifying a group of locations with some common attribute - e.g., Restaurants, Restaurants.Asian, Restaurants.Asian.Chinese, Restaurants.Asian.Chinese.Seafood;


· Formal Categorisation in the form of a Name Reference System, e.g., NAICS, NACE, UPC, specifying the properties appropriate to that Name Reference System;


· List of one or more keywords;


· Partial street address, such as State, City or Suburb.


The XML Request will comprise a Header Block and a Method Block, according to the Request and Response Encoding Requirements.


1.5.1.3 Response Requirements


The parameters of the combined Proximity/Pinpoint response include the required elements of the Point of Interest ADT.


The XML Response will comprise a Header Block and a Method Block, according to the Request and Response Encoding Requirements.


1.5.2 Gateway service requirements


The Gateway Service should support the following requirements:


		Use Case

		Priority



		Client requests a single mobile terminal’s immediate location.

		1



		Client requests single mobile terminal’s periodic location 

		2



		Client requests multiple mobiles’ immediate location 

		2



		Client requests single mobile terminal’s triggered location

		3



		Client request multiple mobiles’ periodic location

		3



		Client requests multiple mobiles’ triggered location

		3





1.5.3 Location Utility service requirements


1.5.3.1 Geocode Service


The following requirements must be supported by the Geocoder Service:


· Given an Address ADT, must be capable of using an address matching Geocoding algorithm to determine a position for the specified address.


· Must be capable of performing geocoding using an incomplete address and return the complete set of address information (i.e., a normalized address).


· Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response (possibly zero) for a particular address supplied in the geocoding request.


· Must be capable of processing one or more addresses in a single geocoding request.


· May provide information on the quality of the result using a ‘match code’.


1.5.3.2 Reverse Geocode Service


The following requirements must be supported by the Reverse Geocoder Service:


· Given a Position ADT, must be able to return one or more locations (i.e., Address ADTs with associated Point geometries), and optionally, the ranges of these locations from the given position, as it is defined in the Position ADT.


· The form of the returned address(es) must be based upon the user’s preference, as stated in the request. The user should be able to specify a preference of StreetAddress, StreetIntersection, or PositionOfInterest (Place and/or PostalCode).  If not specified, the service should default to StreetAddress. 


· Must be capable of returning all location information of a preferred type within an area of interest (AOI ADT – a Circle, Polygon or Box).


Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response (possibly zero) for a given request.


1.5.4 Presentation Service


The main purpose of the Presentation Service is the portrayal of maps, and the portrayal of ADTs as map overlays. The act of portrayal is taking the information from the other OpenLS Core Services (ADTs), adding style and producing output that is easily understood by a user.

· Given a set of route criteria, determine a new route.


· Determine a route, using the routing criteria of an existing route.

The new route may be different than the existing route due to changes in real time traffic, and if the travel start time defaults to the current time, due to transportation network time restrictions, or any other reason.

Include the attribute:


<attribute name="expectedEndTime" type="dateTime" use="optional">

RoutePlanType.


Specifies the date and time at which travel is expected to end.  The format for the end time is specified as Duration.


7. Change projections of returned content


All of the request methods that implement RequestParameters should have either an attribute or a tag that would control the response projection.


to add one more attribute in addition to the ones there, the new attribute would reflect the coordinate system required to use for this request. 


This is the definition used by OpenLS for coordinate reference systems, it’s defined in the GML4XLS schema. OpenLS uses this definition for the geometry, and in order to be consistent with the parameters used across different parts of the schema, it’s important to use it. 


<attribute name="srsName" type="anyURI" use="optional">






<annotation>







<documentation>In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to (Note: These "WKCRS"-ids still have to be specified).  If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS must be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, e.g. a geometric aggregate.</documentation>






</annotation>





</attribute>

It would be an optional attribute with a default to WGS84.


8. Specify preferred distance units in directory responses


Add the following entry to section 9.1.5.1 – Directory Request Parameters:


		Name

		Mandatory?

		Data Type

		Description



		distanceUnit

		N

		DistanceUnitType (ADT)

		Specifies the unit for measuring distance.


Default = “M”





Add a reference to the distanceUnit attribute in the definition of DirectoryRequestType in ADT.xsd:



<complexType name="DirectoryRequestType">



<annotation>




<documentation>ADT for a DirectoryRequest</documentation>



</annotation>



<complexContent>




<extension base="xls:AbstractRequestParametersType">





<sequence>






<element ref="xls:POILocation" minOccurs="0"/>






<element ref="xls:_POISelectionCriteria"/>





</sequence>





<attribute name="sortCriteria" type="xls:SortCriteriaType" use="optional">






<annotation>







<documentation>POI property used to sort the result. Could be by distance from the source POI.</documentation>






</annotation>





</attribute>





<attribute name="sortDirection" type="xls:SortDirectionType" use="optional" default="Ascending">






<annotation>







<documentation>Ascending/Descending</documentation>






</annotation>





</attribute>






<attribute name="distanceUnit" type="xls:DistanceUnitType" use="optional" default="M">






<annotation>







<documentation>Specifies the unit for measuring distance.</documentation>






</annotation>





</attribute>





</extension>



</complexContent>


</complexType>

9. Schema validation fix

In several xsd files (ADT, LocationUtilityService, PresentationService, RouteService):


Import the http://www.opengis.net/gml namespace on line 4.


<import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" schemaLocation="gml4xls.xsd"/>



10. Clarify street encodings

Add to documentation that Element value can be encoded as a simplified street value.


Modify the following:


<complexType name="StreetNameType">




<annotation>





<documentation>The data elements that make up the name of a street</documentation>




</annotation>


to:





<documentation>The data elements that make up the name of a street. There are two valid methods for encoding this information: 1). Use the structured elements and attributes. 2). The element value may contain a simplified string (e.g. 43 West 83rd. Street).</documentation>


11. Documentation change to clarify Street Attributes


The specification should be enhanced to include documentation for the attributes of StreetNameType:


		directionalPrefix

		The direction for a street (e.g., North), placed before the official name.



		typePrefix

		The street type (e.g., Rd or Ave) specified before the official name



		officialName

		The name for a street (e.g., Main).



		typeSuffix

		The street type (e.g., Rd or Ave) specified after the official name



		directionalSuffix

		The direction for a street (e.g., North), placed after the official name.





An example to include:


    <Street directionalPrefix="W" officialName="83RD" typeSuffix="ST" /> 


12. Correlate a route map with a route instruction.

i. Preface 


This OpenGIS Implementation Specification defines OpenGIS Location Services 
(OpenLS): Core Services, Parts 1-5, which consists of the composite set of basic services 
comprising the OpenLS Platform. This platform is also referred to as the GeoMobility 
Server (GMS), an open location services platform.  


This specification was produced immediately following the OpenLS 1/1.1 testbed 
initiatives, October 2001 – October 2002, and reflects lessons learned and the results of 
these efforts. It also includes enhancements and fixes made subsequent to the testbed 
efforts by an ad hoc work group consisting of the sponsors of this specification. 


This document consolidates most of the specifications contained in the Interoperability 
Program Reports developed during the testbed initiatives.

7 Top-Level Architecture 


Figure 2 shows how the concept GeoMobility Server relates to the other elements of an 
LBS architecture. The GeoMobility server is an element offering basic functions on 
which location-based applications are built (the OpenLS Core Services). This server uses 
open interfaces to access network location capacity (provided through a GMLC, for 
instance) and provides a set of interfaces allowing applications hosted on this server, or 
on another server, to access the OpenLS Core Services (see definition of Core Services in 
section 8).  
 
The GeoMobility Server also provides content such as maps, routes, addresses, points of 
interest, traffic, etc. It can also access other local content databases via the Internet.  


In summary, the GeoMobility Server contains: 


 The Core Services and their OpenLS interfaces; 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005)

OGC 05-016 


 The OpenLS Information Model, consisting of ADTs; 


 Possibly, a set of local applications build upon the Core Services and accessing 
them through OpenLS interfaces; 


 Content such as map data, points of interest, routes, and so on used by the Core 
Services. This content can also be hosted on other servers and accessed through the 
Internet; and 


 Possibly other supporting functions for personalization, context management, 
billing, logging, etc.

Note: It is not necessary to specify a Coordinate Reference System for Point geometries that are used by these services 
because the default for all coordinates used by the GeoMobility Server is WGS 84. The coordinate conventions are as 
follows:  


- Default Coordinate Reference System - WGS 84 (srsName=EPSG4326);   


- Coordinate Order - Latitude, Longitude;  


- Value Type - Decimal Degrees;  


- Latitude Sign is +90 at North Pole to -90 at South Pole;  


- Longitude Sign is -180 west from Greenwich at the International Dateline to +180 east from Greenwich at the 
International Dateline. 


 


8.1 Part 1: Directory Service 


This service provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the nearest or 
a specific place, product or service. Through a suitably equipped OpenLS application, the 
subscriber starts to formulate the search parameters in the service request, identifying the 
place, product or service that they seek by entering the name, type, category, keyword, 
phone number, or some other ‘user-friendly’ identifier. A position must also be employed 
Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


7







OGC 05-016 


in the request when the subscriber is seeking the nearest place, product or service, or if 
they desire a place, product or service at a specific location or within a specific area. The 
position may be the current Mobile Terminal position, as determined through the 
Gateway Service, or a remote position determined in some other manner. The directory 
type may also be specified (e.g. yellow pages, restaurant guide, etc). Given the 
formulated request, the Directory Service searches the appropriate online directory to 
fulfill the request, finding the nearest or specific place, product or service, depending on 
the search criteria. The service returns one or more responses to the query (with locations 
and complete descriptions of the place, product, or service, depending upon directory 
content), where the responses are in ranked order based upon the search criteria.  


8.1.1 Pinpoint Directory Service 


Provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the location of a specific 
place, product or service. This service is independent of subscriber location (e.g., the 
subscriber may wish to ‘pinpoint’ a place in a distant country). 
8.1.2 Proximity Directory Service 


Provides subscribers with access to an online directory to find the nearest place, product 
or service. 
From the Usage Scenarios below, it seems unnecessary to separate these usages into two 
services, when they are simply special cases of the same underlying Directory Service 
request. 


The examples below will illustrate that there are two simple cases for finding a particular 
point of interest that roughly correspond to the Pinpoint and Proximity requests: 


1. By some property of the Point of Interest (e.g., unique identifier, name, 
description, phone number, absolute location) 


2. By its location relative to some other point of interest (e.g., Nearest to me, within 
some distance of a specified entity, within some defined boundary). 


Any of these or combinations of these may be made using the combined Directory 
Services request which is specified below. 


8.1.3 Use Cases 


The user of the Directory Service wishes to locate a particular Place, Product or Service.  
The user may constrain the request by specifying parameters that filter out candidate 
places/products/services according to some identifier, attribute, or location. 


Example usage scenarios for Directory Service are captured below. 


 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


8







OGC 05-016 


8.1.3.1 Use Case 1 


Constraining the request by identifier amounts to a Pinpoint White Pages query: “Where 
is the Red Dragon Chinese Restaurant?” 
 
8.1.3.2 Use Case 2 


Constraining the request just by attribute amounts to a normal Yellow Pages query: 
“Where are the Chinese Restaurants?” 


 
8.1.3.3 Use Case 3 


Constraining the request by location relative to a given location amounts to a Proximity 
query: “Where is the nearest Chinese Restaurant to my hotel?” 


 
8.1.3.4 Use Case 4 


Constraining the request by location within a boundary amounts to a different Proximity 
query: “Which Chinese Restaurants are within 500m of my hotel?” 


Any of these requests could result in a response consisting of a text address list, a 
location map, or, if a source location is provided with the request, a route map and a list 
of directions. 


 
8.1.4 Request and Response Parameters for Directory Service 


This section specifies the request and response parameters for the Directory Service. Note 
that it not required to specify a Spatial Reference System as all co-ordinates will be 
referenced to WGS 84 (latitude, longitude).

the GMLC or MPC through which OpenLS services obtain position data for Mobile 
Terminals. This interface is modeled after the MLP specified in OMA 3.0 for Standard 
Location Immediate Service.  


8.2.1 Use cases 


These use cases have been grouped into 3 priority categories, with priority 1 having the 
highest priority and the only case for mandatory support.  


The Gateway Service should support the following:

OGC 05-016 


Use Case Priority 


Client requests a single mobile terminal’s immediate 
location. 


1 


Client requests single mobile terminal’s periodic location  2 


Client requests multiple mobiles’ immediate location  2 


Client requests single mobile terminal’s triggered location 3 


Client request multiple mobiles’ periodic location 3 


Client requests multiple mobiles’ triggered location 3 


 


8.2.2 A Location Request Use Case 


A subscriber wants to use a Location-Based Service. The Gateway Service is employed 
to obtain the position of the subscriber’s mobile terminal from the network. A Location 
Service Client sends the request to determine a position to the Gateway. The Gateway 
calculates the position of the subscriber’s mobile terminal and forwards to the Location 
Service Client, which may store it for as long as needed.

8.3 Part 3: Location Utility Service (Geocode/ Reverse Geocode) 


This service performs as a Geocode by determining a geographic position, given a place 
name, street address or postal code. It also returns a complete, normalized description of 
the place (which is useful, say, when only partial information is known). The service also 
performs as a reverse Geocode by determining a complete, normalized place name/street 
address/postal code, given a geographic position. Both the Geocode and reverse Geocode 
may return zero, one, or more responses to a service request, depending on subscriber 
request information, the algorithm being employed, and the match criteria. 


8.3.1 Use Cases 


8.3.1.1 Geocode Service 


Once a Geocode Service determines a position from a partial or complete address, then 
the pertaining information element becomes a location-based resource that can be readily 
exploited by another service, like Directory or Route. 


8.3.1.1.1 Use Case 1 – Given an Address, Find a Position 


A company has a database with a list of its customers and addresses. They want to 
geocode their database and have a geometry (Point) attached to the addresses. This will 
then be used to display the locations of customers on a mobile device. 


8.3.1.1.2 Use Case 2 – Drive to an Address (Position) 


A motorist wishes to drive from home to an address in Regent Street, London. The 
address is geocoded and its location used as a destination within in a route planning 
application. 


8.3.1.1.3 Use Case 3 – Given a Place/ Street Name, Find its Position and Display it on a Map 


Elvis Presley wants a map to his new dwelling place. He only knows part of the address: 
“Heartbreak Hotel”, ”Lonely Street”. 


 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


19







OGC 05-016 


The partial address is fed into a Geocode Service that determines the complete 
normalized address and position of Elvis’ dwelling. This in turn is fed into a Route 
Service that calculates the route from Elvis’ current position (as determined for his cell 
phone) to the dwelling. The result is a map.  


  


8.3.1.2 Reverse Geocode Service 


8.3.1.2.1 Use Case 1 – Given a Position, Find an Address 


The Reverse Geocoding Service is normally requested by an application that merely 
needs to determine the address for a given position. The application sends a Position 
ADT to the Reverse Geocode, which returns the Address of the position.  


8.3.1.2.2 Use Case 2 – Where am I? 


A mobile phone user is walking down a road and wants to know the address of the 
building that she is standing outside.  


The returned address information returned may be displayed for the subscriber, used to 
generate a voice command or otherwise used by the OpenLS applications.  


8.3.1.2.3 Use Case 3 – Provide Location Context 


How “Get Location Service” is provided by the Reverse Geocode Service: 


A user needs an answer to the question “Where Am I?” based on their current location. 
They desire expanded “location context”, e.g., street, place, jurisdiction. The application 
sends the Position ADT to the Reverse Geocode Service, which returns the expanded 
location information for that position. The application can then extract the location 
information corresponding to the required context “street address”, “place” etc.  


8.3.2 Request and Response Parameters 


This section specifies the primary request and response parameters for the Geocode and 
Reverse Geocode Services.  


8.3.2.1 Geocode Service 


Primary GeocodeRequest Parameters 


A collection of one or more of the parameters below. 


Name Mandatory? Data Type Description

May be unstructured free 
form address, partial or 
complete addresses.  


Primary GeocodeResponse Parameters 


For each Address request, the response (GeocodeResponseList) will contain a collection 
of the following parameters:  


Name Mandatory? Data Type Description 


numberOfAddresses 
(attribute of 
GeocodeResponseList) 


Y Integer (non-
negative) 


Number of valid responses 
(GeocodedAddress) found

request; may be zero. 


List of 1→∞ GeocodedAddress(es) sorted by the Accuracy of the match, with highest 
accuracy first, each with the following parameters:  


Point Y Point (Geometry) The position of the 
GeocodedAddress 
response resulting from the 
geocoding operation.  


Address Y Address ADT The actual Address for the 
GeocodedAddress 
response. These are 
normalised addresses. 


GeocodeMatchCode N GeocodingQOSType The QoS information for 
the GeocodedAddress 
response. Provides 
information on the quality 
of the match. These results 
consist of an Accuracy 
(float value within the 
range 0.0 – 1.0) and a 
MatchCode (MatchType)

8.3.2.2 Reverse Geocode Service 


 


Primary ReverseGeocodeRequest Parameters 


Name Mandatory? Data Type Description 


Position Y Position ADT The starting position 
(lat,long)  for Reverse 
Geocoder.  


ReverseGeocodePrefe
rence 


 


 
 
 
     


N ReverseGeocodePref
erenceType 


Describes the preference for 
the response from the 
Reverse Geocoder Service: 
StreetAddress, 
IntersectionAddress, or 
PositionOfInterest (Place 
and/or PostalCode). If not 
specified, then the service 
will return the nearest 
StreetAddress. 


Primary ReverseGeocodeResponse Parameters 


Name Mandatory? Data Type Description 


List of 0→∞ ReverseGeocodedLocation(s) sorted by the SearchCentreDistance (the 
distance between the starting Position in the request and each Point-Address response), in 
order (with shortest distance first), where each ReverseGeocodedLocation has the 
following parameters:  


Address Y Address ADT The actual Address for the 
ReverseGeocodedLocation 
response. These are 
normalised addresses. 


Point Y Point (geometry) The position (lat, long) of 
the 
ReverseGeocodedLocation 
response. 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


22







OGC 05-016 


SearchCentreDistance N Float (decimal 
metres) 


Distance of Point from 
starting Position. 


 


Notes: 


1. SearchArea must contain starting Position; therefore the service must be capable 
of validating this. 


2. All response lists are sorted in order of shortest to longest SearchCentreDistance 
(default in metres). 


3. If SearchArea is not specified, only the nearest valid response is returned. 


8.4 Part 4: Presentation Service  


This service renders geographic information for display on a Mobile Terminal. Any 
OpenLS Application may call upon this service to obtain a map of a desired area, with or 
without map overlays that depict one or more OpenLS ADTs, such as Route Geometry, 
Point of Interest, Area of Interest, Location, Position and/or Address. The service may 
also be employed to render route directions from Route Maneuver List ADT and/or 
Route Instructions List ADT.  


8.4.1.1 Output Parameters  


Defines what the size and encoding of the portrayed map should be using the following 
criteria: 


• Width – The width of the map in pixels. 


• Height – The height of the map in pixels. 


• Format – Parameter that specifies what the encoding of the map should 
be.  This is specified as a mime-type.  The mime-types supported are left 
up to the implementation. 


• Transparency - Boolean that defines the opacity of the background of the 
map. 


• Background Color – Defines the background color of a map if it is 
opaque. 


• Content – Specifies what type of content would be returned, whether the 
URL or the data as base64 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


23







OGC 05-016 


The default behavior of the map is to return the exact image size as specified in the 
request. The Harmonization group is working on harmonizing the different specifications 
like WMS and OpenLS, to have consistent behavior where both specs are concerned.  


8.4.1.2 Context  


Defines what area of the world the map is portraying.  This can be defined in the 
following ways: 


• Bounding Box- Two-point box in a specific SRS that defines the 
extents of the map (WGS 84 is the default).  This is the same 
bounding box used in WMS and is present for compatibility with 
it. 


• Center Point and Scale - The center point defines the center of 
your map at a particular scale and projection.   


o Center Point – The center point of the map.  This point is 
specified in WGS 84 as a latitude/longitude in decimal 
format. 


o Scale – The ratio between device units and world units.  
Specified as the number of world units per device units.  
Thus 1:50000 would be expressed as a scale of 50000. 


o Azimuth – The orientation of the map.  This is expressed 
in clockwise degrees from north. 


o DPI – Dots per inch of the device.   


o SRS – Spatial Reference System.  Provides what projection 
should be used when creating the map. 


o DisplayScale - A ratio of distance.  For example 1:5000 
would be expressed as 5000, it's always expressed per 1 
pixel of the display. 


If context is not specified the implementation must derive it from the ADTs. 


8.4.1.3 Overlays  


Defines a list of ADTs for portrayal on the map. 


• ADT (Abstract Data Type)  – ADTs are usually obtained as outputs from 
other core services.  To date we have Position ADT, Route ADT, POI ADT 
and Map ADT. 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


24







OGC 05-016 


o Z Order – The order in which the ADTs are laid on top of each other 
over the base map.  


• Custom Style – This is either a named-style or a user-defined style. This 
specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a 
placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future 
versions to define. 


 If a style is not specified it is up to the implementation to use a default. 


 


8.4.1.4 Base Map  


Provides a backdrop for the ADTs and is made up of a set of layers.  The user determines 
the layers that are to be included or excluded from the base map in their request. The 
implementation must create and support its own list of layers for the user to choose from.   


• Layers – The list of layers of interest 


o Filter – Determines if the layers are included or excluded. “Give me 
only the following layers” or “Give me all layers but the following”. 
The default behavior is to include all the layers. But when filters need 
to be applied that’s when they would need to be defined. 


• Custom Style – This is either a named-style or a user-defined style. This 
specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a 
placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future 
versions to define. 


If a style is not specified it is up to the Implementation to use a default. 


 


8.4.1.5 Style  


Defines how the ADTs should look. The implementation should create and support their 
own list of styles for the consumer to choose from. 


• Named Style – A string that is provided by the implementation. 


• User Defined Style – The consumer defines the content of the style. This 
specification doesn’t define a specific format for style description. This is a 
placeholder for custom extensions to use. Also, a placeholder for future 
versions to define.

8.4.1.6 Get Capabilities 


Provides the user with the list of capabilities that the implementation provides.  Consists 
of the following: 


• Layers - Layers provided by the implementation.  


• Style – Styles provided by the implementation. 


• Format – Mime-types supported by the implementation. 


• SRS – Spatial Reference Systems supported, in EPSG:XXXX format. 


8.4.2 Use Cases 


8.4.2.1 Use Case 1 


Joe User wants to see where his house is located on a map. To satisfy this use case the 
presentation service needs to show a base map with the position of Joe’s house overlaid 
onto it. 


For an example see section 8.4.4.1. 


8.4.2.2 Use Case 2   


Planning a family road trip, Joe User wants to see how get from his house in Calgary, 
Alberta, to the hotel he has booked in San Diego, California.  To satisfy this use case the 
presentation service needs to show map(s) with the route and the two points of interest 
overlaid onto it.    


For an example see section 8.4.4.2.

8.4.4 Request and Response Pairs for Use Cases 


The following are examples of one way to solve the use cases defined in Section 8; they 
are not the only solutions. 


8.4.4.1 Use Case 1 Example 


In order to satisfy Use Case 1, the application must acquire a Position ADT for where 
Joe’s home is located.  One way to do this is to have the Geocoder Service geocode his 
address, thus determining a Position ADT. 


In this example we are asking for: 


• 640x480 image in PNG format 


• At a scale of 1:20000 


• In WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) projection 


• With a north orientation

8.4.4.2 Use Case 2 Example 


A prerequisite for this use case are Position ADTs for Joe’s home and the Hotel.  We also 
need the Route ADT, which shows the route from the home to the hotel. The Route ADT 
may be obtained from the Route Service. 


Because the route is very large and we want to see it at a detailed scale we will be asking 
for multiple maps. 


We are asking for: 


• (N) maps centered on different points of the route 


• 640x480 image in PNG format 


• At a scale of 1:80000 


• In UTM projection 


• With a north orientation 


• Base map will consist of only the road network and landmarks 


• The base map and the ADTs will be displayed using the “post-modernistic” style 


• The position of Joe’s House and the Hotel will be drawn on top of the route

8.5 Part 5: Route Service  


This service determines a route for a subscriber. The subscriber must use a navigation 
application to set up the use of the service. They must indicate the start point (usually the 
position acquired through the Gateway Service, but this could be a planned trip from a 
specified location, say, from their home), and the endpoint (any location, like a place for 
which they only have the phone number or an address, or a place acquired through a 
search to a Directory Service). The subscriber may optionally specify waypoints, in some 
manner, the route preference (fastest, shortest, least traffic, most scenic, etc.), and the 
preferred mode of transport. The subscriber may optionally store a route for as long as 
needed, thus requiring the means to also fetch a stored route. 


An enhanced version of this service, the Navigation Service, is described under separate 
cover (see Normative References, section 3). The Navigation Service supports the same 
parameters as the Route Service, plus additional parameters for navigation purposes.  


9.5.2 Use Cases 


Use Case 1: The user wants to know: Which route should I take? The user has specified 
the endpoints, and optionally some waypoints, in some manner, or these points have been 
specified for the user. The starting point is either defined from a GPS or cellular network 
measurement or entered manually by the user. This information is then fed to a service 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


36







OGC 05-016 


that determines the route. Optionally, the user may specify route determination criteria. 
These criteria might be: fastest, shortest, least traffic, most scenic, etc. and can also 
specify the preferred mode of transport of the user. The routing algorithm might default 
to a single criterion, such as fastest. The route can also be optionally stored on the 
terminal or application server. The user may store it for as long as needed, thus requiring 
the means to also fetch a stored route.

10 General Use Cases 


Use Case I. A subscriber wants to access a list of restaurants nearby its location. He/she 
does not have any positioning capabilities on his/her device. The position of the 
subscriber is provided by network elements (GMLC/MPC).  


 


The following sequence of events take place: 


• A subscriber accesses the telecom operator portal via the wireless network; 


• The portal identifies the service requested by the subscriber and directs the 
request to a ‘Restaurant Guide’ application running on the GeoMobility Server; 
this application can also be hosted on a 3rd party server; 


• The requested service sends a request to a GMLC to get the position of the 
subscriber’s Mobile Terminal; 


• The GMLC provides an estimation of the Mobile Terminal position; 


• Knowing the subscriber position, the ‘Restaurant Guide’ application sends a 
request, including the returned Mobile Terminal position in the form of a Position 
ADT, to a Directory Service that returns a list of restaurants within a certain 
radius around the estimated subscriber position; 


• The list of restaurants is sent back to the subscriber; 


• An application running on the Mobile Terminal allows the subscriber to view and 
interact with the list. [The next actions the subscriber is likely to take are to select 
a restaurant from the list and then ask for the directions and route map to assist 
them in driving from where they are to the chosen restaurant.] 


 


An example of sequence for a service request is illustrated in the following figure.

The MLP defined by OMA (formerly LIF) is used to access GMLC/MPC positioning 
information. GMS resources are accessed through OpenLS APIs. 


11 Architecture Details 


The Operator’s Portal likely hosts the following functions: 


1. Front-end functions to support session management, authentication of the 
subscribers, requests handling, etc. This box can also be a simple relay, 
transferring requests for services from subscribers to 3rd party applications. 


2. LBS support functions for billing, privacy management and roaming.  


3. A Service Platform hosting different applications (including proxies to OpenLS 
Applications that run on the GMS) and various supporting functions to support 
personalization, context management, etc. The service platform may also access a 
Location Server through the Gateway Service (based upon OMA 3.0).  


4. Optionally, the Service Platform may host OpenLS Applications like ‘Personal 
Navigator’ and ‘Concierge’. 


 


The GMS hosts the following functions: 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


45







OGC 05-016 


1. Possibly, OpenLS Applications, like ‘Personal Navigator’ and ‘Concierge’. These 
applications access OpenLS Core Services through their APIs. They are the 
consumers of OpenLS ADTs. 


2. OpenLS Core Services (Route, Location Utility, Directory, Presentation, and 
Gateway). These services are accessible through OpenLS APIs, as defined in the 
specifications. They in turn access the location content needed to perform their 
functions. 


3. Location Content Databases.  Contain any map data, route networks, address data 
navigation support data, and directories with any place, product or service 
information. Accessed through OGC Interfaces (Web Feature Server, Web Map 
Server, Web Coverage Server) or other interfaces, depending on implementation 
requirements. [More specification work is planned here in future test beds.] 


4. OpenLS Applications and Core Services can also access other GMSs and location 
content databases hosted by 3rd parties. 


 


The following figure highlights the functional roles of the Portal, Service Platform, GMS, 
GMLC/MPC, and 3rd party platforms. 


 


12 General Features 


• The “lang” attribute of the XLS element may be used to specify a preferred 
language for formatting responses.  For example, this attribute may be used to 
request that route instructions be returned in alternate languages from the Route 
Service. Valid values for the xls:lang attribute are defined in XML 1.0 ( which 
references IETF RFC 1766, which inturn are constructed from two-letter language 
code defined by ISO 639 and from two-letter country codes as defined by ISO 
3166).  For example:  en-GB, en-US, fr 


• srsName attribute of the XLS element may be used to specify the preferred 
coordinate system to process the request, and return the response in, if 
supported by the server. 


 


13 Conformance Requirements and Procedures 


Conformance and Testing for this Implementation Specification must be based upon the 
normative schema in Annex A. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, 
and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance, are specified in ISO 19105: 
Geographic information — Conformance and Testing.  


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


46







OGC 05-016 


The sponsors of this specification have devised a conformance test requirements and 
procedures to be defined in a separate document 


 


14 Future Work 


14.1 OpenLS 1.0 


This specification is the result of nearly two years of effort and  
implementation testing. Considerable effort has been invested in harmonizing  
this specification suite with other OGC specifications, particularly GML  
3.0, and OMA specifications, particularly OMA 3.0. It is the view of the  
submitters that the results of these harmonization efforts are adequate and  
sufficient, based upon the requirements defined in this document and the  
results of implementation and test activities. The submitters recognize that  
this harmonization process must continue so that every attempt is made to  
satisfy the needs of the market, to address the feedback received from  
implementers and other OGC members, and to remain consistent with evolving  
OGC and OMA specifications.  
 


14.2 OpenLS 1.1 


The release of OpenLS 1.1 was meant to offer some fixes to the service schema. No 
major changes were intended. Changes that might affect the way the services work, will 
be addressed for a release of OpenLS 2.0. Also, the group has invested considerable time 
to address the need for a conformance test and work on providing it soon.

      <documentation> We need to look more closely at this choice 
block (it's too restrictive). Since we don't have a getCapabilities, there is really no 
way that a client can discover the information a Directory Service could possibly 
return. Also, clients have no way to specify which of these information types they 
want returned (ReferenceSystem, POIInfoList, Point, and/or Address), like we do for 
GeoCode. Plus, when a Directory Service has two or more of these types, with the 
choice block there is no way for the a client to receive the full information set. Do we 
want to change this to a sequence block and/or change POIAttributeList and/or Point 
to optional? Also, we need to examine the role of POI in this form since it may not 
return a Point or Address and therefore may not have sufficient info to be used in 
location services that require a position of some sort.

 The AddressType is the Address_ADT for OpenLS and it supports the concepts 
of the OGC Geocoder document 01-026r1 
 with some modifications which resulted in both simplifications and improved 
handling capability.  The definition is also 
 broad enough to handle some of the more obscure occurrences of street 
addressing as well as handling the 
 case of when all you have is an un-parsed string representing the complete 
address.  We could generalize this even 
 further to handle non-street addressing schemes found in other industries, such 
as the Municipal Survey Addressing 
 schemes that are used by Municipalities to address the lots on which a building 
may be placed but that is probably a 
 future requirement outside the scope of OLS1.

OGC Implementation Specification OGC 05-016
 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 133
 


Annex A.2: OpenGIS Location Services (OpenLS) Requirements 
(Informative) 


1 Requirements 


1.1 Terminology 


The key words “must”, “should” and “may” are to be interpreted in the detailed 
requirements as follows: 


Must—The item is an absolute requirement of the specification. 


Should— There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore the 
item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before 
choosing a different approach. 


May—The item will be considered, but further examination is needed to 
determine if the item should be treated as a requirements. 


Note that only the Italic versions of these terms are to be interpreted as above.  


1.2 General Requirements 


Note: These requirements were taken from the document entitled: “XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements”, 
dated 15 Apr 2002, v1.1, and supersede that document. 


These requirements pertain to the exchange of location information for the GeoMobility 
Server, an open location services platform. As such, these requirements reflect the 
character and nature of location information exchange for the OpenLS Core Services.  
The following sponsor observations led to these requirements: 


 The location services market demands technology that subscribes to the principal 
of simplicity so that these services will be widely adopted throughout the 
wireless-IP realm. The objective is to shield the wireless provider from “GIS 
complexity”. We are driven by the desire to hit the mainstream with simple, 
essential, widely adopted capabilities. Also, one size does not necessarily fit all. 
Consider these technologies that have emerged for wireless IP: 


o Java: J2ME 


o SVG: Mobile SVG 


o kDom and kXML (kxml.enhydra.org) 







OGC 05-016 


 Small form factor mobile terminals with limited memory, power, and processing 
resources and limited bandwidth demands lightweight solutions for location 
information exchange. Devices widely available in the market could be classified 
into three general classes.  


o Class A - Devices with very limited capabilities like pagers and cell 
phones  


o Class B - Devices with moderate capabilities like Palm OS PDA  


o Class C - Devices with relatively good capabilities like Windows CE 
devices  


 Current network capabilities are very limited in bandwidth. Bandwidth available 
for devices ranges between 9.6 Kbps and 28.8 Kbps in general 


 Next generation devices will be smarter and therefore will accept location 
information for limited onboard processing. 


 Back-end server traffic is also a concern. Messages should be as compact as 
possible. 


        1.2.1 Usage Scenarios 


The usage scenarios for XLS are captured in the use cases for the OpenLS Core Services 
(see references in section 3).   These use cases define the general scope of XLS.  


1.2.2 Design Guidelines 


The following design guidelines were considered for XLS. They are based on 
participants’ experience in both the wireless community and with the OGC process.  
They constitute general design guidance toward achieving OpenLS objectives. 


1.2.2.1 General Guidelines 


1) XLS must be based on current market conditions in terms of available 
technology, content and industry standards. 


2) XLS should be simple and sufficient. This means that it should be able to 
adequately represent geographic objects for location services with minimum 
overhead and complexity (i.e., easy to encode and decode). As such, XLS 
must implement the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS. These types must be 
extensible.  


3) XLS should have small footprint (compact for transmission to low powered 
mobile terminals with limited memory).

OGC 05-016 


4) XLS should be developed such that it can be implemented in J2ME based 
platforms, and accessible by kDom and kXML APIs, with their current 
capabilities and maybe other wireless platforms that may emerge. 


5) A single profile of XLS may be insufficient to deal with the variety of mobile 
devices. (For example, Mobile SVG will have two profiles: SVG-Basic and 
SVG-Tiny). Similarly, XLS may exist in two profiles that correspond to 
different classes of devices. In this case an appropriate capabilities discovery 
scheme should be devised to allow clients to discover which profiles are 
supported by the server  


1.2.2.2 Compatible, Consistent and Extensible 


1) XLS should be scalable so that it can support a wide variety of devices, users, 
and applications. 


2) A simple data model should support XLS for all Abstract Data Types. This 
will minimize the overhead for feature (object) construction and 
deconstruction for OpenLS applications and services. 


3) XLS should be defined in XML schema (xsd). 


4) XLS types should be defined in a way that would give them enough 
flexibility to be used according to SOAP encoding rules. 


5) XLS specification activities should be harmonized with ISO 19133 
(Navigation), ISO 19118 (XML Encoding rules) and GML.  


6) XLS should be designed so that XLS instances can be transformed (e.g., 
through an XSLT stylesheet) into GML.  


7) An appropriate versioning scheme should be devised to guarantee clear 
versioning numbers.  


1.2.3 Detailed Requirements 


1.2.3.1 General 


1) XLS must be based upon well-defined Abstract Data Types for OpenLS. 


2) Similar to GML, XLS should maintain the separation between location 
information content and presentation. XLS can be directly rendered on the 
mobile device or through a standard technology like Mobile SVG. (Current 
parsers for the devices do not have XSLT support.)

1.2.3.2 Encoding 


1) XLS must encode the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS in a compact form. 
The effort to keep the model simple goes hand-in-hand with the need to avoid 
the overhead of unnecessary encoding, decoding and feature 
construction/deconstruction complexity for users of OpenLS services. 


2) XLS should use short tags. 


3) XLS may use a minimum tag set that is sufficient to meet the encoding 
requirements for the OpenLS Abstract Data Types. 


4) XLS may include binary encodings. 


5) XLS should avoid multiple levels of nesting. (Keep the depth of the trees 
shallow for simplicity and to minimize the size of code written to handle it. 
This helps to keep the applications installed on wireless devices as small in 
size as possible.)  


1.2.3.3 Properties 


1) XLS must support the properties required for Abstract Data Types for 
OpenLS. 


2) Properties must be simple properties. Multiple nesting levels should be 
avoided in properties to avoid complexity. 


1.2.3.4 Metadata 


1) XLS should support metadata.   


1.2.3.5 Geometry Elements 


1) XLS must include point, line, line-string and polygon geometries, per OGC 
Simple Feature Model.  


2) XLS may include other geometries.  


1.2.3.6 XLS Feature Relationship Schema 


1) XLS may use Xlink to reference local resources or remote resources in the 
same document only, in an appropriate way that would work with the limited 
capabilities of available parsers. 


2) XLS must support simple relationships in which relationships do not carry 
properties.

OGC 05-016 


1.2.3.7 XLS Feature Schema 


1) XLS should support a simplified feature model that doesn’t require multiple 
nesting levels. 


2) XLS must support the Abstract Data Types for OpenLS and related 
operations. 


1.3 Interface Envelop and Encoding Requirements 


This section outlines the requirements pertaining to the encoding of the interfaces (i.e., 
the Request and Response Parameters) for OpenLS Core Services. 


1.3.1 Key Concepts 


a) A Client Application is any application that interacts with Core Services, 
whether it resides on an end-user device or on a server.  


b) A Request is the XML string that is passed from a Client Application to a Core 
Service. 


c) A Response is the XML string that is passed from a Core Service to the Client 
Application.  


d) A Session is a series of interactions between a Client Application and one or 
more Core Services. Those interactions are typically in the form of series of 
Requests and Responses.  


e) Well-Known Request Type and Well-known Response Type are Types that are 
known to both Client Applications and Core Services. 


f) In this document we refer to the ‘Request and Response pair’ for a Core Service 
as: R/R. 


1.3.2 General Usage Pattern  


Figure 9 illustrates the general usage pattern for XML based R/R in OpenLS. The use 
case starts with the execution of a Client Application that processes a user’s request for 
service. This in turn leads to a request for the use of a Core Service, e.g., a Directory 
Service.  The Client Application encodes the request for the Core Service as an XML 
Request. Using the HTTP/Post method, the XML Request is sent to a Servlet. The Servlet 
parses the XML Request, and according to the Request tags, generates the proper 
function call to the Core Service. The Core Service processes the Request and sends back 
the Response to the Servlet. The Servlet in turn encodes the Response as an XML 
Response and forwards it to the Client Application. The Client Application in turn 
decodes the XML Response and applies the proper presentation functions for display on 
the Client Device. In the case of thin Client Devices, it is possible that parsing of the

XML Response is done on the server and the portrayal content is streamed directly to the 
Client Device.

Figure 9. Usage Pattern for OpenLS Request/Response Pairs 


1.3.3 Assumptions 


1) The architecture is based on connectionless protocol. A Client Application may 
establish a connection for making a Request, and disconnect right after a 
Response has arrived.  


2) The Client Application knows the Request URI for the OpenLS Core Service. 
This includes the Port Number. 


3) Client Applications are aware of all Interfaces that the Core Service exposes. 


4) The Core Service can parse and understand the semantics of the XML Request 
Parameters generated by the Client Application. 


5) Core Services know all the mandatory and optional Request Parameters generated 
by Client Applications. 


6) Client Applications can parse and understand the semantics of the XML Response 
Parameters generated by Core Services. 


7) Client Applications know all mandatory Response Parameters, and possibly some, 
all, or none of the optional Response Parameters generated by Core Services. If an 
optional parameter is sent to a Client Application, it is then assumed that the 
Client Application can understand it; otherwise the Client Application generates 
an error message or ignores this optional Response Parameter.

OGC 05-016 


1.3.4 General Requirements 


The following requirements pertain to both Request and Response Schemas: 


1) The R/R schemas must be based on XML Schema, re: W3C Recommendation (2 
May 2001). 


2) Encoded ADT-based R/R Parameters in XML must be consistent with the 
encoding guidelines and requirements as stipulated in the latest version of the 
XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements (section 0).  


3) R/R pairs must be consistent with the XLS ADTs. 


4) R/R Pairs must be Well-Known Types.  


5) Upon receiving a Request from a Client Application, a Core Service must send at 
least one Well-Known Response to the Client Application. A Response might be 
an answer to the Request, an error message, or an acknowledgement of receiving 
the Request. 


6) XML R/R instances must be well formed and valid with respect to their schemas.  


1.3.5 Encoding Requirements 


1.3.5.1 Naming 


1) If applicable, you should satisfy encoding name conventions as stipulated in the 
latest version of the XML for Location Services (XLS) Requirements (section 0). 


2) You should use English descriptors that accurately describe the 
attribute/element/type, etc. For example, use names like firstName, grandTotal, or 
CorporateCustomer. Although names like x1, y1, or fn are easy to type because 
they’re short, they do not provide any indication of what they represent and result 
in schemas that are difficult to understand, maintain, and enhance.  


3) Be consistent in using terminology. You should use terminology that applies for 
the application domain. For example, if you create an element MobileDevice and 
the mobile operators call it MobileTerminal, use the latter.  


4) You should use avoid long names. Some standards recommend a maximum of 13 
characters and some 15 characters. For OpenLS, try to limit names to 15 
characters in length.  


5) Do your best to avoid the use of abbreviations. If you must use an abbreviation, 
then be consistent with its use. For example, if you want to use a short form for 
the word “number”, then you should use something like ‘nbr’ or ‘num’  (it 
doesn’t really matter what form you use), but be consistent in its use. 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


139







OGC 05-016 


6) You should avoid names that are similar or differ only in case. For example Name 
and name. This aids interpretability of the schema.  


7) You should avoid names that only differ in their plurality. For example, the 
attribute names mobileTerminal and mobileTerminals should not be used together. 


8) In general, you should use lower case letters, but capitalize the first letter of 
element names, enumerations and type names. You should use all lower case for 
attribute names, unless you are using a compound name (see the next 
requirement).  


9) You should use mixed case to make compound names more readable. 
Specifically, you should use upper case for the first letter in all but the first word 
of a compound Attribute name (e.g., attributeName), or upper case for the first 
letter of all words comprising a compound element name, type name or 
enumeration (e.g. ElementName). 


10) Abstract Types should use the keyword ‘Abstract’ in their name. For example, an 
Abstract Type for Device might be represented as: AbstractDeviceType. 


11) You should use an underscore (i.e. ‘_’) to prefix abstract element names (e.g., 
_Device).  


12) You should avoid the use of acronyms. If you find it necessary to use an 
acronym, you should capitalize all letters. For example, using the acronym ‘GIS’, 
use GISAttribute for an attribute and GISObject for an element.  


1.3.5.2 Structures 


1) If possible, you should use Attributes instead of Elements. You should use 
Attributes if they are simple types and have cardinality = 1, at most. 


2) You should avoid using Anonymous Types. Named types allow reuse. 


3) You should avoid using the same local Element name for different types.  


4) You must use “sequence” blocks instead of “all” blocks within “ComplexType”. 
Complex types that contain "all" blocks cannot be legally subtyped.  


5) You should avoid Anonymous “choice” Blocks. 


6) You should only declare List types when necessary.  


7) You should avoid unsignedInt, unsignedByte, unsignedLong, and unsignedShort 
and use facets instead when you need to restrict the domain.

OGC 05-016 


1.3.5.3 Coordinate Systems and Units of Measure 


1) You should use degrees as the default units of measure for angles. 


2) You should use meters as the default units of measure for distances and 
coordinates.  


3) You should express azimuth in degrees measured clockwise from true north. 


4) You should use WGS 84 as the default datum and Coordinate Reference System. 


5) You should follow the OGC recommendation for Coordinate Reference Systems 
(SRS).  


6) You should follow the OGC recommendation for Units of Measure. 


1.3.5.4 Name Spaces 


1) All schemas generated under the OpenLS initiative must set the targetNameSpace 
attribute value to: http://www.opengis.net/xls. 


1.3.6 Request Requirements 


Each OpenLS Core Service shall have an XML Request Packet that contains the Request. 
The XML Request Packet must include at least two main Blocks1, a Header Block and 
one or more Method Blocks (which will contain the actual requests):  


1) Request Header Block 


 a) A Request Header Block should contain the username and password for the 
Client Application.  


 b) A Request Header Block should contain the type of the client device, if 
applicable (based upon a well-known list of known types).  


 c) A Request Header Block may contain a client-defined Session Identifier, to be 
echoed back by the server. 


2) Request Method Block(s) 


 a) An XML Request should contain zero or more Method Blocks.  


 b) A Request Method Block must contain a “global” unique method name (Type 
NMT) that identifies the method that will be invoked by the Core Service. The

141



http://www.opengis.net/xls





OGC 05-016 


term “global” refers to a unique ID that identifies a method in the context of 
the applicable OpenLS Core Service.  


 c) A Request Method Block must contain Request Version, which indicates the 
version of the Request that it supports.  


 d) A Request Method Block must contain Response Version, which indicates the 
version of the Response that the Client Application supports. 


 e) A Request Method Block must contain a maximum of one Sub-Block that 
contains the XML payload (the request parameters) for the specified method.  


 f) Each Request Method Block must have a Request Identifier. The Request 
Identifier is a string that must appear in the Method Request Tag as an ‘ID’ 
attribute. A Request Identifier must be unique within the scope of a session.  


1.3.7 Response Requirements 


The XML Response Packet must include at least two main Blocks, a Header Block and 
one or more Response Method Blocks:  


1) Response Header Block 


 a) A Header Block may include the status of the Response (use a standard list of 
enumerations for status -- TBD). 


 b) A Header Block should contain a Session Identifier, which corresponds with the 
applicable Request Session Identifier. 


Note: The error list associated with the Header Block is for authentication errors and other errors generated for the 
envelop, whereas error lists associated with a Response Method Block are for individual responses. 


2) Response Method Block(s) 


 a) An XML Response must contain at least one Response Method Block.  


 b) The Response Method Block must contain zero or one Sub-Blocks that contain the 
XML payload for the specified method.  


 c) A Response Method Block must contain Response Version, which indicates the 
version used to encode the Response. 


 d) A Response Method Block may include the status of the Method Response (use a 
standard list of enumerations for status -- TBD). 


 e) A Response Method Block may include zero or more Fault (Error) Elements, 
which indicate the error status (use a standard enumerated list of errors -- TBD), 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


142







OGC 05-016 


code and description generated during the scope of the session. [Note: Error 
handling is based upon the SOAP Fault Element.] 


 f) Response Packets may have the same identifier as the Method Request Tag. The 
‘ID’ is a must if this method employs a Request Identifier, and it must match the 
Request Identifier. Having more than one Response Method Block is usually a 
result of sending more than one Request Method Block. 


1.3.8 HTTP Transaction Protocol Requirements 


1.3.8.1 HTTP Request Requirements 


1) OpenLS Core Services must conform to HTTP/1.1 Post Request according to 
IETF RFC 2616.  


2) HTTP/1.1 Post Requests must contain Two Blocks. The first Block must be the 
header that conforms to HTTP/1.1. The second Block, the body, must contain 
the content payload of the Request. 


3) HTTP/1.1 Post Request Header Block: 


 a) Must include the Content-Length. 


 b) Must include the Content-Type. For the purpose of this test bed, the Content-
Type must be text/xml. 


 c) Must contain CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed). 


4) HTTP/1.1 Post Request Body Block 


 a) The Request Block must include the XML payload of the Request. 


 
The following is an example of an HTTP/1.1 Post Request:

OGC 05-016 


1.4 Abstract Data Type Requirements 


The ADTs are well-known information types that are used by the Core Services, and 
form the Information Framework for the GeoMobility Server.  


1.4.1 Address ADT  


Address ADT contains address information for a geographic place. Addresses reference 
and uniquely identify particular points of interest and can serve as the basis for 
aggregating data for that location. The Address ADT consists of a street address (or 
intersection), place name (e.g. country, municipality, etc.), postal code, street locator, 
building locator, and supplemental address information. As used here, addresses are the 
means of referencing primarily residences and buildings (of all types, where a subscriber 
may conduct business). 


1.4.2 Area of Interest (AOI) ADT  


Contains an Area of Interest as defined by a named circle, bounding box, or polygon. 
Used to as a search parameter or can be displayed for a subscriber (e.g. Hot Zone). 


1.4.3 Location ADT  


The extensible, abstract type for all expressions of Location that can be used by OpenLS 
application and services to specify the location of a target or a subscriber. Location is the 
root of a semantic tree that includes a Point, Position ADT, Address ADT, and POI ADT 
as its subtypes.  


1.4.4 Map ADT  


Map ADT contains a rendered map that results from the Map Portrayal Operation of the 
Presentation Service. It can then be used as input to other Presentation Services.  Map 
ADT consists of content information (format, width and height) and context information 
(bounding box, center point and scale). 


1.4.5 Point of Interest (POI) ADT  


A place or entity with a fixed position that may be used as a reference point or a target in 
an OpenLS service. The POI is the primary output from a Directory Service, and thus, is 
also the “place” where one might obtain a product or service. It contains name, type, 
category, address, phone number, and other directory information about the place, 
product, and/or service. 


1.4.6 Position ADT  


Position ADT contains any observed or calculated position, in the broad semantic context 
of the use of the term. It primarily contains a geographic position and quality of position. 
Position is the primary output from a Gateway Service. Position maps to the semantics of 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


145







OGC 05-016 


the Location, Shape and Quality of Position elements, as defined in the Mobile Location 
Protocol (MLP) Specification (Version 3.0, OMA). Thus, it contains the full definition of 
a position of a Mobile Terminal (Standard Location Immediate Service). Position may 
also be used by an OpenLS application to represent any position of interest. Position is 
distinguished from POI, which is a well-known place with a position, name, address, etc.  


1.4.7 Route Instructions List ADT  


Route Instructions List ADT contains a list of travel instructions consisting of turn-by-
turn directions and advisories along the route, ordered in sequence of their occurrence, 
and formatted for presentation to the user. Route Instructions List ADT is generated by 
the Route Service and “presented” to a subscriber via the Presentation Service. 


1.4.8 Route ADT  


The Route ADT is actually two ADTs: Route Summary and Route Geometry. Route 
Summary contains the route’s overall characteristics, such as its start point, waypoints, 
end point, transportation type, total distance, travel time, and bounding box. Route 
Geometry contains a list of geographic positions along the route, ordered in the sequence 
of planned travel, starting with the position of the route’s origin and ending with the 
position of the route’s destination. The geometry includes the positions of all nodes along 
the route, including waypoints. The geometry also includes intermediate points needed to 
describe the geometric shape of the route segments between each node in the route. These 
two ADTs are generated by the Route Service and “presented” to a subscriber as routing 
information, e.g. as a route displayed over a map, via the Presentation Service, or they are 
used directly by an application to guide a mobile subscriber to their destination. 


 


1.5 Service Requirements 


1.5.1 Directory Service requirements 


1.5.1.1 General 


The definition of request/response pairs defined below will encompass the requirements 
for both Pinpoint and Proximity Directory Services.  The two usages of the Directory 
Service will be affected by selecting the appropriate optional parameters in the XML 
schema. 


1.5.1.2 Request Requirements 


The parameters of the combined Pinpoint/Proximity request must include: 


• Directory Type: e.g., White Pages, Yellow Pages, Green Pages, etc. 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


146







OGC 05-016 


 
The Pinpoint query will use parameters that will uniquely identify the Point of Interest. 
At least one of the following options may be used to identify the target location: 


• Point of Interest Name, identifying a specific location – e.g., Red Dragon Chinese 
Restaurant; 


• Point of Interest Point, identifying an exact location coordinate of the Point of 
Interest; 


• Point of Interest Address, identifying the street address of the Point of Interest. 


The Proximity query will use parameters that will identify a shortlist of candidate 
locations by distance from a location that may itself be specified by a Pinpoint query, 
e.g., “Give me the taxi rank nearest to the Red Dragon Chinese Restaurant”. 


This may involve a combination of Proximity parameters to spatially constrain the 
search: 


• Proximity Type: type of proximity algorithm – e.g., Linear Distance, Bounding 
Polygon; 


• Source Location – point for determining proximity (possibly a POI); 


• Proximity Minimum Distance; 


• Proximity Maximum Distance; 


• Proximity WithinBoundary, a polygon for Bounding Polygon search; 


It will also involve a combination of parameters to constrain the result of the search: 


• Maximum Number of elements to be returned: e.g., nearest 5 restaurants. 


• Sort criteria (attribute to sort on; ascending/descending). 


Other parameters may be used to constrain the search, resulting in a shortlist of Points of 
Interest: 


• List of Point of Interest Place/Product/Service types identifying a group of locations 
with some common attribute - e.g., Restaurants, Restaurants.Asian, 
Restaurants.Asian.Chinese, Restaurants.Asian.Chinese.Seafood; 


• Formal Categorisation in the form of a Name Reference System, e.g., NAICS, NACE, 
UPC, specifying the properties appropriate to that Name Reference System; 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 


 


147
• List of one or more keywords; 







OGC 05-016 


• Partial street address, such as State, City or Suburb. 


The XML Request will comprise a Header Block and a Method Block, according to the 
Request and Response Encoding Requirements. 


1.5.1.3 Response Requirements 


The parameters of the combined Proximity/Pinpoint response include the required 
elements of the Point of Interest ADT. 


The XML Response will comprise a Header Block and a Method Block, according to the 
Request and Response Encoding Requirements. 


1.5.2 Gateway service requirements 


The Gateway Service should support the following requirements: 


Use Case Priority 


Client requests a single mobile terminal’s immediate 
location. 


1 


Client requests single mobile terminal’s periodic location  2 


Client requests multiple mobiles’ immediate location  2 


Client requests single mobile terminal’s triggered location 3 


Client request multiple mobiles’ periodic location 3 


Client requests multiple mobiles’ triggered location 3 


 


1.5.3 Location Utility service requirements 


  


1.5.3.1 Geocode Service 


The following requirements must be supported by the Geocoder Service: 


• Given an Address ADT, must be capable of using an address matching Geocoding 
algorithm to determine a position for the specified address. 


Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc (2005) 
 


148







OGC 05-016 


• Must be capable of performing geocoding using an incomplete address and return the 
complete set of address information (i.e., a normalized address). 


• Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response (possibly zero) for a 
particular address supplied in the geocoding request. 


• Must be capable of processing one or more addresses in a single geocoding request. 


• May provide information on the quality of the result using a ‘match code’. 


 


1.5.3.2 Reverse Geocode Service 


The following requirements must be supported by the Reverse Geocoder Service: 


• Given a Position ADT, must be able to return one or more locations (i.e., Address 
ADTs with associated Point geometries), and optionally, the ranges of these locations 
from the given position, as it is defined in the Position ADT. 


• The form of the returned address(es) must be based upon the user’s preference, as 
stated in the request. The user should be able to specify a preference of StreetAddress, 
StreetIntersection, or PositionOfInterest (Place and/or PostalCode).  If not specified, 
the service should default to StreetAddress.  


• Must be capable of returning all location information of a preferred type within an 
area of interest (AOI ADT – a Circle, Polygon or Box). 


Must be able to indicate the number of matches in the response (possibly zero) for a given 
request. 


 


1.5.4 Presentation Service 


The main purpose of the Presentation Service is the portrayal of maps, and the portrayal 
of ADTs as map overlays. The act of portrayal is taking the information from the other 
OpenLS Core Services (ADTs), adding style and producing output that is easily 
understood by a user.

14.3 Route Service Requirements 


The Route Service shall support the following functionality: 


• Given a set of route criteria, determine a new route. 


• Determine a route, using the routing criteria of an existing route. 
 
The new route may be different than the existing route due to changes in real time 
traffic, and if the travel start time defaults to the current time, due to transportation 
network time restrictions, or any other reason. 


• After determining the route, return any combination of the following information:

5. Editorial changes 


Make requirements and Annex. 


Make Gateway consistent with the other services in editing. 


 


6. Add expectedEndTime to route. 


Include the attribute: 


<attribute name="expectedEndTime" type="dateTime" use="optional"> 


RoutePlanType. 


Specifies the date and time at which travel is expected to end.  The format for the end 
time is specified as Duration. 


 


7. Change projections of returned content 


All of the request methods that implement RequestParameters should have either an 
attribute or a tag that would control the response projection. 


to add one more attribute in addition to the ones there, the new attribute would reflect the 
coordinate system required to use for this request.  


 


This is the definition used by OpenLS for coordinate reference systems, it’s defined in 
the GML4XLS schema. OpenLS uses this definition for the geometry, and in order to be 
consistent with the parameters used across different parts of the schema, it’s important to 
use it.

9. Schema validation fix 


In several xsd files (ADT, LocationUtilityService, PresentationService, RouteService): 


Import the http://www.opengis.net/gml namespace on line 4. 


<import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" schemaLocation="gml4xls.xsd"/>  


10. Clarify street encodings 


Add to documentation that Element value can be encoded as a simplified street value. 


Modify the following:

   <documentation>The data elements that make up the name of a street. 
There are two valid methods for encoding this information: 1). Use the structured elements and 
attributes. 2). The element value may contain a simplified string (e.g. 43 West 83rd. 
Street).</documentation> 


11. Documentation change to clarify Street Attributes 


The specification should be enhanced to include documentation for the attributes of 
StreetNameType: 


directionalPrefix The direction for a street (e.g., 
North), placed before the 
official name. 


typePrefix The street type (e.g., Rd or 
Ave) specified before the 
official name 


officialName The name for a street (e.g., 
Main). 


typeSuffix The street type (e.g., Rd or 
Ave) specified after the official 
name 


directionalSuffix The direction for a street (e.g., 
North), placed after the official 
name. 


 


An example to include: 


    <Street directionalPrefix="W" officialName="83RD" typeSuffix="ST" />

						  We need to look more closely at this choice block (it's too restrictive). Since we don't have a getCapabilities, there is really no way that a client can discover the information a Directory Service could possibly return. Also, clients have no way to specify which of these information types they want returned (ReferenceSystem, POIInfoList, Point, and/or Address), like we do for GeoCode. Plus, when a Directory Service has two or more of these types, with the choice block there is no way for the a client to receive the full information set. Do we want to change this to a sequence block and/or change POIAttributeList and/or Point to optional? Also, we need to examine the role of POI in this form since it may not return a Point or Address and therefore may not have sufficient info to be used in location services that require a position of some sort.  
[MM] 17/3/03. Made the change from a choice block to a sequence block. Made the elements optional inside the sequence block

	The AddressType is the Address_ADT for OpenLS and it supports the concepts of the OGC Geocoder document 01-026r1
	with some modifications which resulted in both simplifications and improved handling capability.  The definition is also
	broad enough to handle some of the more obscure occurrences of street addressing as well as handling the
	case of when all you have is an un-parsed string representing the complete address.  We could generalize this even
	further to handle non-street addressing schemes found in other industries, such as the Municipal Survey Addressing
	schemes that are used by Municipalities to address the lots on which a building may be placed but that is probably a
	future requirement outside the scope of OLS1.

	The AbstractStreetLocatorType is an abstract type  for describing the location on a street within an AddressType.
	We do this because the components of a location on a street vary greatly throughout the world.
	So that the schema can accommodate this variation we create derived types such as the
	BuildingLocatorType which has the components for an apartment or suite or floor within a building.

			 The data elements that make up the name of a street. There are two valid methods for encoding this information: 1). Use the structured elements and attributes. 2). The element value may contain a simplified string (e.g. 43 West 83rd. Street).
An example:      
			
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 The direction for a street (e.g., North), placed before the official name.
					
				
				 
					 
						 The street type (e.g., Rd or Ave) specified before the official name

	So that the schema can accommodate this variation we create derived types such as the
	USZipCodeType which has the components for a US zipcode

			 This abstract element is the head of a substitutionGroup hierararchy which may contain either simpleContent or complexContent elements.  It is used to assert the model position of "class" elements declared in other GML schemas.  
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Database handle for the object.  It is of XML type “ID”, so is constrained to be unique in the XML document within which it occurs.  An external identifier for the object in the form of a URI may be constructed using standard XML and XPointer methods.  This is done by concatenating the URI for the document, a fragment separator “#”, and the value of the id attribute.  
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 All complexContent GML elements are directly or indirectly derived from this abstract supertype 
	to establish a hierarchy of GML types that may be distinguished from other XML types by their ancestry. 
	Elements in this hierarchy may have an ID and are thus referenceable.  
		
		 
	
	
	 
		 
			 Global element which acts as the head of a substitution group that may include any element which is a GML feature, object, geometry or complex value
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_Curve" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all (continuous) curve elements.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 An abstraction of a curve to support the different levels of complexity. The curve can always be viewed as a geometric primitive, i.e. is continuous.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 This is the abstract root type of the geometric primitives. A geometric primitive is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. All primitives are oriented in the direction implied by the sequence of their coordinate tuples.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 All geometry elements are derived directly or indirectly from this abstract supertype. A geometry element may have an identifying attribute ("gml:id"), a name (attribute "name") and a description (attribute "description"). It may be associated with a spatial reference system (attribute "srsName"). The following rules shall be adhered: - Every geometry type shall derive from this abstract type. - Every geometry element (i.e. an element of a geometry type) shall be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of _Geometry.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 This attribute is included for backward compatibility with GML 2 and is deprecated with GML 3. This identifer is superceded by "gml:id" inherited from AbstractGMLType. The attribute "gid" should not be used anymore and may be deleted in future versions of GML without further notice.
					
				
				 
					 
						 In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to (Note: These "WKCRS"-ids still have to be specified).  If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS must be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, e.g. a geometric aggregate.
					
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_GeometricPrimitive" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all (pre- and user-defined) geometric primitives.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_Geometry" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all geometry elements of GML 3. This includes pre-defined and user-defined geometry elements. Any geometry element must be a direct or indirect extension/restriction of AbstractGeometryType and must be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of "_Geometry".
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			  				A LineString is a special curve that consists of a single segment with linear interpolation. It is defined by two or more coordinate tuples, with linear interpolation between them. It is backwards compatible with the LineString of GML 2, GM_LineString of ISO 19107 is implemented by LineStringSegment. 			
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 GML supports two different ways to specify the control points of a line string. 1. A sequence of "pos" (DirectPositionType) or "pointRep" (PointPropertyType) elements. "pos" elements are control points that are only part of this curve, "pointRep" elements contain a point that may be referenced from other geometry elements or reference another point defined outside of this curve (reuse of existing points). 2. The "coordinates" element allows for a compact way to specifiy the coordinates of the control points, if all control points are in the same coordinate reference systems and belong to this curve only. The number of direct positions in the coordinates list must be at least two.
					
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 DirectPosition instances hold the coordinates for a position within some coordinate reference system (CRS). Since DirectPositions, as data types, will often be included in larger objects (such as geometry elements) that have references to CRS, the "srsName" attribute will in general be missing, if this particular DirectPosition is included in a larger element with such a reference to a CRS. In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on the value of the containing object's CRS.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to (Note: These "WKCRS"-ids still have to be specified).  If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS must be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, e.g. a geometric element like point, curve, etc. It is expected that the attribute will be specified at the direct position level only in rare cases.
					
				
				 
					 
						 The attribute "dimension" is the length of coordinate sequence (the number of entries in the list). This is determined by the coordinate reference system.
					
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 XML List based on XML Schema double type.  An element of this type contains a space-separated list of double values
		
		 
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A Point is defined by a single coordinate tuple.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 GML supports two different ways to specify the direct poisiton of a point. 1. The "pos" element is of type DirectPositionType. 
					
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A LinearRing is defined by four or more coordinate tuples, with linear interpolation between them; the first and last coordinates must be coincident.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 GML supports two different ways to specify the control points of a linear ring.
1. A sequence of "pos" (DirectPositionType) or "pointRep" (PointPropertyType) elements. "pos" elements are control points that are only part of this ring, "pointRep" elements contain a point that may be referenced from other geometry elements or reference another point defined outside of this ring (reuse of existing points).
2. The "coordinates" element allows for a compact way to specifiy the coordinates of the control points, if all control points are in the same coordinate reference systems and belong to this ring only. The number of direct positions in the coordinate list must be at least four.
					
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
				An abstraction of a ring to support surface boundaries of different complexity.
			
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_Ring" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all closed boundaries of a surface patch.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A boundary of a surface consists of a number of rings. In the normal 2D case, one of these rings is distinguished as being the exterior boundary. In a general manifold this is not always possible, in which case all boundaries shall be listed as interior boundaries, and the exterior will be empty.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
			        Encapsulates a ring to represent the surface boundary property of a surface.
			
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A boundary of a surface consists of a number of rings. The "interior" rings seperate the surface / surface patch from the area enclosed by the rings.
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A Polygon is a special surface that is defined by a single surface patch. The boundary of this patch is coplanar and the polygon uses planar interpolation in its interior. It is backwards compatible with the Polygon of GML 2, GM_Polygon of ISO 19107 is implemented by PolygonPatch.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
				An abstraction of a surface to support the different levels of complexity. A surface is always a continuous region of a plane.
			
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_Surface" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all (continuous) surface elements.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 This is the abstract root type of the geometric aggregates.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_GeometricAggregate" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all geometric aggremates.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Use the "MultiSurface" element instead.
		
	
	 
		 
			 
				A MultiPolygon is defined by one or more Polygons, referenced through polygonMember elements.			
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
			
		
	
	 
		 
			 This property element either references a polygon via the XLink-attributes or contains the polygon element.
		
	
	 
		 
			 A property that has a polygon as its value domain can either be an appropriate geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document). Either the reference or the contained element must be given, but neither both nor none.

			  Some common reasons for a null value:   
			
        innapplicable - the object does not have a value
        missing - The correct value is not readily available to the sender of this data.  
                           Furthermore, a correct value may not exist.
        template - the value will be available later
        unknown - The correct value is not known to, and not computable by, the sender of this data. 
                           However, a correct value probably exists.
        withheld - the value is not divulged 
        
        Specific communities may agree to assign more strict semantics when these terms are used in a particular context.  
      
		
		 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A CircleByCenterPoint is an ArcByCenterPoint with identical start and end angle to form a full circle. Again, this represenation can be used only in 2D.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
				This variant of the arc requires that the points on the arc have to be computed instead of storing the coordinates directly. The control point is the center point of the arc plus the radius and the bearing at start and end. This represenation can be used only in 2D.
			
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 GML supports two different ways to specify the control points of a curve segment.
1. A "pos" (DirectPositionType) or "pointRep" (PointPropertyType) element. The "pos" element contains a center point that is only part of this curve segment, a "pointRep" element contains a point that may be referenced from other geometry elements or reference another point defined outside of this curve segment (reuse of existing points).
2. The "coordinates" element can be used to specifiy the coordinates of the center point, too. The number of direct positions in the coordinate list must be one.
					
					 
					 
						 
							 The radius of the arc.
						
					
					 
						 
							 The bearing of the arc at the start. This type is used by GML 3 geometry in this schema file only
						
					
					 
						 
							 The bearing of the arc at the end.
						
					
				
				 
					 
						 The attribute "interpolation" specifies the curve interpolation mechanism used for this segment. This mechanism
uses the control points and control parameters to determine the position of this curve segment. For an ArcByCenterPoint the interpolation is fixed as "circularArcCenterPointWithRadius".
					
				
				 
					 
						 Since this type describes always a single arc, the attribute is fixed to "1".
					
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
				Curve segment defines a homogeneous segment of a curve.

application schema.
		
		 
			 
			 
			 
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 The "_CurveSegment" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all curve segment elements, i.e. continuous segments of the same interpolation mechanism.

			 Number with a scale.  
      The value of uom (Units Of Measure) attribute is a reference to a Reference System for the amount, either a ratio or position scale.

Although the document is well formed and valid, according to the rules and constraints contained in the OpenLS specification the content of an element or attribute is inconsistent with the content of other elements or their attributes.
				
			
			 
				 
					 Other error in an element content or attribute value. Although the document is well formed and valid, the element content or attribute value contains values that do not conform to the rules and constraints contained in the OpenLS specification and is not covered by other error codes. The Error message attribute should be used to indicate the nature of the problem.
				
			
			 
				 
					 Message Delivery Failure. A message has been received that either probably or definitely could not be sent to its next destination. Note: if severity is set to Warning then there is a small probability that the message was delivered.
