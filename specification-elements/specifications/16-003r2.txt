1. Scope 

This informative CDB document provides a list and description of the instance-level 
attribution fields held in Navigation Dataset Instance Attribute files. This content was 
originally in Annexes H and I, Volume 2 CDB Best Practice. 

For ease of editing and review, the standard has been separated into 12 Volumes and a 
schema repository.
