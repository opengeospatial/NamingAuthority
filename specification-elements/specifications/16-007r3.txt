i. Abstract 
This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard defines the conceptual model for the OGC 
CDB 1.0 Standard. The objective of this document is to provide an abstract core conceptual 
model for a CDB data store (repository). The model is represented using UML (unified modeling 
language). The conceptual model is comprised of concepts, schema, classes and categories as 
well as their relationships, which are used to understand, and/or represent an OGC CDB data 
store. This enables a comparison and description of the CDB data store structure on a more 
detailed level. This document was created by reverse-engineering a UML model and 
documentation from the OGC CDB standard as a basis for supporting OGC interoperability. One 
of the important roles of this conceptual model is to provide a UML model that is consistent with 
the other OGC standards and to identify functional gaps between the current CDB data store and 
the OGC standards baseline.  This document references sections of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core 
Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure [OGC 15-113]. 
 
NOTE: The simulation community uses the term “synthetic environment data” to mean all the 
digital data stored in some database or structured data store that is required for use by simulation 
clients. From the geospatial community perspective, these data are essentially the same as GIS 
data but with, in some cases, special attributes, such as radar reflectivity. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

ogcdoc, OGC document, UML, conceptual model, raster, tiles, vector, CDB, Common Data 
Base, simulation, visualization, synthetic environment. 

iii. Preface 
The industry-maintained CDB model and data store structure has been discussed and 
demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings since September, 2013. This document, the 
first UML conceptual model for OGC CDB standard, is one of the 12 documents that comprise 
the OGC CDB modular standard. The UML conceptual model establishes a single set of 
consistent concepts that could be also implemented using other encoding mechanisms. 

The CDB standard is originally based on the OGC CDB Best Practice documents, which were 
submitted to the OGC by CAE Inc. on behalf of the CDB implementation community and user 
group. CDB is currently widely implemented in the defence and aviation simulation 
communities. The intent is that this initial OGC version of the CDB standard be backwards 
compatible with existing implementations but that terminology and concepts be aligned as 
appropriate with the OGC technical baseline. Future work is planned to align the standard with 
other OGC standards and to provide Best Practices focused on how to use CDB with the existing 
OGC standards baseline, such as OGC GeoPackage, CityGML, Web Map Service (WMS), Web 
Feature Service (WFS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the 
subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held responsible for 
identifying any or all such patent rights.

The OGC CDB standard is based on and derived from an industry developed and maintained 
specification, which has been approved and published as OGC Document 15-003:  OGC 
Common DataBase Volume 1 Main Body.  An extensive listing of contributors to the legacy 
industry-led CDB specification is at Chapter 11, pp 475-476 in that OGC Best Practices 
Document (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935 ).

vi. Future Work 
The CDB community anticipates that additional standardization will be required to prescribe 
content appropriate to targeted simulation applications.  In its current form, the CDB standard 
does not mandate synthetic environmental richness, quality and resolution. 

The OGC CDB Standards Working Group (SWG) members understand there is a requirement 
for eventual alignment of the CDB standard with the OGC/ISO standards baseline. In Version 1 
of the CDB standard, effort was invested to begin aligning terminology and concepts, 
specifically in the coordinate reference system discussions and requirements.   



6 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The current version of the CDB standard is fully backwards compatible with version 3.2 of the 
CDB specification as defined and implemented by the current CDB implementer and user 
community. The requirements for a CDB data store are focused on the ability to store, manage, 
and access extremely large volumes of geographic content. In this version of the standard, initial 
harmonization with the OGC and ISO standards baseline has begun. For example, where 
appropriate, the CDB simulation community terms and definitions have been replaced with 
OGC/ISO terms and definitions. Further, the standards documents have been reorganized and 
structured to be consistent with the OGC Modular Specification Policy. However, the CDB 
SWG and community recognize the need to further harmonize and align this standard with the 
OGC baseline and other IT best practices. There has already been considerable discussion in this 
regard.  

Based on such discussions and comments received during the public comment period, the 
following future work tasks are envisioned: 

1. Describe explicitly how the CDB model may or may not align with the OGC DGGS 
standard; 

2. Provide best practice details on how to use WMS, WFS, and WCS to access existing 
CDB data stores. This work may require Interoperability Experiments to better 
understand the implications of these decisions; 

3. Extend the supported encodings and formats for a CDB data store to include the use of 
the OGC GeoPackage, CityGML, and InDoorGML standards as well as other broadly 
used community encoding standards, such as GeoTIFF. This work may require 
performing OGC Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of 
these decisions. 

4. Further align CDB terminology to be fully consistent with OGC/ISO terminology. 
 
Making these enhancements will allow the use and implementation of a CDB structured data 
store for application areas other than aviation simulators.

1- Overview of the OGC CDB Conceptual Model 
Conceptual modelling is a structural methodology for describing how the components of a CDB 
data store may be implemented based on the modular specification design of the OGC CDB Core 
Standard. The following table defines the general CDB data store requirement and an overview 
of key elements implemented in a compliant CDB data store. 

Requirement Class 1 

Req. ID http://opengis.net/spec/CDB/1.0/core/OveralConceptualModel 

Dependency All of the requirements of the OGC CDB core document 

Req. Text A minimum compliant CDB shall contain the version metadata; when any dataset is provided 
in a CDB, it shall comply with the corresponding mandatory requirements of the OGC CDB 
Core Standard (Volume 1 <URL>.  

 

This section presents the conceptual model for an OGC CDB compliant data store. This model 
can used as the basis for the CDB standard in other application domains, along with its 
requirements, extension, file-based structure, data formats, access, and the discovery of services.

As it can be seen in Figure 2, the CDB standard relies on three important concepts to organize 
geospatial data: Tiles, Layers (or datasets) and Levels of Detail (LOD) which are described here:  
● Tiles: Tiles organize the data into zones defined by location with respect to a WGS84 

reference system2. The CDB storage structure allows efficient searching, retrieval and 
storage of any information contained within a CDB data store. The storage structure 
portion of the standard geographically divides the world into geodetic tiles (bound by

of the culture, be it its bounding sphere, its bounding box or its modeled representation (if supplied).

latitudes and longitudes), each containing a specific set of features (such as terrain 
altimetry, vectors) and models (such as 3D and Radar Cross Sections models), which are 
in turn represented by their respective datasets. The datasets define the basic storage unit 
used in a CDB data store. The geographic granularity is at the tile level while in each tile, 
the information granularity is at the dataset level defined by layers. 

● Layers: Layers organize different types of data in a tile. The CDB standard data store 
model is also logically organized as distinct layers of information. The layers are 
independent from each other (i.e., changes in one layer do not impose changes in other 
layers). 

● Levels-of-Detail (LODs): LODs organize the data in each layer of each tile by its detail. 
The availability of LOD representations is critical to real-time performance. Most 
simulation client-devices can readily take advantage of an LOD structure because, in 
many cases, less detail/information is necessary at increasing distances from the 
viewpoint of a simulation rendering. The CDB standard requires that each geographic 
area be represented in an LOD hierarchy in accordance with the availability of source 
data. 

 

 
Figure 2: CDB data organization structure 

2- CDB General Data Organization 
The CDB is composed of several datasets that share a common structure. The following sections 
present the general organization and structure of all CDB datasets. The CDB standard does not 
define or enforce an operating system or file system. Nonetheless, the implementation of a CDB 
storage sub-system must conform to absolute minimum file system requirements called for by 
the standard. A CDB data store uses existing common file formats for storing data in various 
formats such as TIFF/GeoTIFF (raster data), JPEG 2000 (imagery data), OpenFlight (3D 
models), ShapeFiles (vector data and radar cross sections), RGB (textures), XML (Metadata) and 
ZIP (file collection). The current version of CDB uses a consolidation of data dictionaries from 
DIGEST, DGIWG, SEDRIS and UHRB (See Volume 3: CDB Terms and Definitions). In 
addition, it is possible to extend the CDB Feature Data Dictionary (FDD) by using the extension 
capabilities and adding a new FDD XML schema file to access additional feature data codes. The 
UML diagram in Figure 3 describes how the data is categorized in tiles, layers and LODs. This is 
the basis for the CDB geospatial data categorization.

Figure 4: UML diagram of the Geocell, tile and LOD concept 

2-2- CDB File System 
This section describes how a current version of a CDB conformant data store uses the 
computer’s native file system to store data in files and directories, what the CDB versioning 
structure is, and how the data is categorized. Further this section defines the structure of a CDB 
conformant data store, i.e., the name of all directories forming the CDB hierarchy, as well as the 
name of all files found in the CDB hierarchy. An important feature of the CDB standard is that 
all CDB file names are unique and that the filename alone is sufficient to infer the path of the 
file. 

The CDB data store is composed of several datasets that usually reside in their own directory; 
however some datasets share a common structure. The top-level directory of the CDB data store 
follows the following structures: 
● \CDB\: This is the root directory and does not need to be “\CDB\” and can be any valid 

path name on any disk device or volume under the target file system it is stored on.  
● \CDB\Metadata\: This directory contains the specific XML metadata files which are 

global to the CDB. 



14 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● \CDB\GTModel\: This is the entry directory that contains the Geotypical3 Models 
Datasets. 

● \CDB\MModel\: This is the entry directory that contains the Moving Models Datasets. 
● \CDB\Tiles\: This is the entry directory that contains all tiles within the CDB instance. 
● \CDB\Navigation\: This is the entry directory that contains the global Navigation 

datasets. 
Most of the CDB datasets are organized in a tile structure and stored under \CDB\Tiles\ 
directory. The tile structure facilitates access to the information in real-time by any runtime 
client-devices. However, for some datasets such as Moving Models or Geotypical Models that 
require minimal storage, there is no significant advantage to be added into such a tile structure. 
Such datasets are referred to as global datasets; they consist of data elements that are global to 
the earth. 

A CDB Version is a collection of CDB and/or user-defined datasets. A CDB Version contains 
data belonging to a single version of a CDB conformant data store. One CDB Version may refer 
to another one, which is the basis for the CDB File Replacement Mechanism. The concept of a 
CDB Version is illustrated using the following UML diagram (Figure 4). 
 

                                                
3 A model is said to be geotypical if it instanced multiple times within a CDB data store.  Geotypical models 
correspond to representative (in shape, size, texture, materials and attribution) models of real-world manmade or 
natural 3D cultural features.

Figure 5: UML diagram of CDB version concept 

The diagram shows that a CDB Version contains CDB Datasets. In addition, it states which CDB 
Version Number has been used to build the CDB content. Finally, the CDB Version has a 
reference to another CDB Version. This reference allows the creation of a chain of CDB 
Versions. By chaining two CDB Versions together, the user can replace files in a previous CDB 
Version with new ones in a newer CDB Version data store. The diagram shows that a CDB

Extension inherits all the attributes of a CDB Version and adds its own attributes, a name and a 
version number (of the extension). The client application checks the name attribute to recognize 
and process known CDB Extensions and unrecognized CDB Extensions are skipped. 

2-3- Model Type 
The term Model refers to all of the modeled representations of a cultural feature. The model type 
features of a CDB can be represented using the following UML diagram. 3DModel, referred to 
as a GSModel, is unique. In the case where the 3DModel is instanced, it is referred to as a 
GTModel. A 3DModel that is capable of movement is called a MModel. In the case where a 
MModel is positioned by the modeler, it is called a statically-positioned MModel.

The term Model-LOD refers to a specific level of detail of a Model. The main properties of the 
CDB 2D/3D model type UML diagram are listed below.

2-3-1   3D Moving Model  
A moving model is typically characterized as if it can move (on its own) or be moved. More 
specifically within the context of this standard, the model is not required to be attached to a 
cultural point feature (geographic location).  

 
Figure 7: UML diagram of the 3D moving model 

During the course of a multi-player simulation, each client-device is typically solicited to provide 
a modeled representation of each player. The activation of such players requires the client-device 
to access the appropriate modeled representation of each player. There are a large number of

simulations where the player types are characterized by their Distributed Interactive Simulation4 
(DIS) code. To this end, the CDB data store provides a moving model library whose structure 
provides a convenient categorization of models by their DIS code as shown in the following 
diagram. 

 
Figure 8: UML diagram of moving model codes 

The “xml_vesion” attribute of a moving model code is used to indicate the version of the XML 
file containing the list of codes. It is independent from the version of the Standard and also the 
version of the Schema. 

2-4- Vector Data Model 
Vector tiles differ from their raster counterpart in three important ways. First of all, the vector 
tiles’ internal structure permits a non-uniform distribution of elements within the tile, i.e., the 
position of each element within the tile is explicit. Secondly, the vector tiles’ internal structure 
permits a variable number of elements within the tile confines. Finally, it is possible to control 
the distribution of the element types from a single list. 

Conceptually, the LOD of a vector tile implicitly provides the average density of elements within 
the tile. The run-time level-of-detail behavior that controls the rendered number of data elements 
depends on various parameters and on the off-line filtering process.

3- Metadata Schema 
Metadata datasets contain information, global to a CDB implementation that defines its structure, 
naming hierarchies, default values, allowable values, and status. All metadata files are formatted 
using XML files, and their XSD schemas can be found in the \CDB\Metadata\Schema\ folder 
delivered with the CDB Standard. 

3-1- Light Names Hierarchy 
The light name hierarchy for a CDB compliant data store is described in detail within the table 
found in Volume 2 Annex J of the OGC CDB Core Standard. This provides a description of the 
entire naming hierarchy, including the hierarchical relationship of the levels with respect to each 
other and the position of each light type within this hierarchy. To this end, the lights hierarchy 
definition metadata is stored in an XML file in the metadata CDB directory. “Lights.xml” file 
contains the name of each light type and a unique code with each light type. Light codes have a 
one-to-one association with light types; consequently, the light codes are unique among all light 
types. For run-time access of this data, clients must be able to retrieve such information. The 
below diagram (figure 9) shows the UML diagram of light data hierarchy to define and validate 
the content of the CDB light names hierarchy found in /CDB/Metadata/Lights.xml. 

  
Figure 10: UML diagram of light names hierarchy 



20 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

This attribute “Version” represents the version number of the Light.xml file.  

3-2- Client Specific Lights Definition  
Client-devices use the light type code as an index to lookup the client-specific properties and 
characteristics of each light type using a Lights_xxx.xml. The CDB standard offers a 
complementary approach to modifying the appearance of lights. This approach provides basic 
control over light intensity, color, lobe width and aspect, frequency and duty cycle for potential 
use by simulation implementations. This approach also permits a modeller to add new light types 
to the CDB light hierarchy. The below UML diagram (figure) presents the schema for the fields 
of the Lights_xxx.xml which is generated from the schema file located at 
\CDB\Schema\Lights_Tuning.xsd.  

 
Figure 11: UML diagram of client specific lights definition  

3-3- Model Components Definition  
The CDB Standard provides the means to unambiguously tag any portions of a 3D model 
(moving model or cultural feature with a modeled representation) with a descriptive name. 
Component model names are stored in the model components’ definition file, at 
\CDB\Metadata\Model_Components.xml which is delivered with the standard distribution 
package.

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
Figure 12: UML diagram of the model components definition 

CDB Model Components is a list of components which are made up of the component names 
along with their descriptions.  

3-4- Base Materials Table 
A Base Material represents a basic material such as water, vegetation, concrete, glass, steel 
which has a unique name. The components of a Base Material are listed in Volume 1 Section 
2.5.1 of the CDB Core standard in Table 2-6: Components of a Base Material. A Base Material 
Table (BMT) is provided for run-time access by client applications. More details on the file 
format can be found in Volume 1 Core Standard section 5.1.3, Base Material Table. CDB Base 
Materials are listed and stored in an XML file named \CDB\Metadata\Materials.xml. The format 
of the file is defined by the following UML diagram generated from an XML schema that is 
delivered with the CDB standard in the file named 
\CDB\Metadata\Schema\Base_Material_Table.xsd.

3-5- Composite Material Tables  
Composite Material Tables provide a structured arrangement by which Composite Materials can 
be defined. There are several Composite Material Tables spread across the CDB hierarchy. A 
CMT is a list of one or more composite materials. Note that all Composite Material Tables 
follow the following UML diagram.

3-6- Default Values Definition Table 
Default values for all datasets can be stored in the default values’ metadata file 
“\CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml”. Default values, defined throughout the CDB standard, are listed 
in Volume 2 Annexes for the Core CDB Standard (normative) - Annex S and the below UML 
diagram indicates the schema provided in \CDB\Metadata\Schema\Defaults.xsd to define and 
validate the content of Defaults.xml. There are two types of default values: read and write default 
values (‘R’ or ‘W’.) Generally, read default values are values to be used when optional 
information is not available. Write default values are default values to be used by CDB creation 
tools to fill mandatory content when information is either missing or not available. The default 
value name is a unique name identifying a default value for a given dataset. Valid default value 
names are listed in Annex S. Each default value has a type. Valid default value data types are 
“float”, “integer” and “string”. 

 
Figure 15: UML diagram of the default values definition table 

The “XML_Version” attribute is used to indicate the version of the XML file containing the list 
of CDB Default Values. It is independent from the version of the standard. 



24 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

3-7- Version 
Each CDB version has a version control file that is called Version.xml. Its contents should be 
defined and validated by the following UML diagram which is generated from the content of    
Defaults.xsd in the schema folder of the CDB. 

The optional <PreviousIncrementalRootDirectory> element is used to refer to another CDB 
Version. This is the mechanism used to chain together two CDB versions. The mandatory 
<Specification> element indicates the CDB standard that is used to produce the content of the 
CDB Version. Note that version numbers of the standard are limited to the version numbers from 
the legacy industry-maintained CDB specification: 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0, and OGC V1.0 from this 
standard; other values are not permitted. Finally, the optional <Extension> element indicates that 
this CDB Version is in fact a CDB Extension. A version control file that does not have a CDB 
Extension indicates that the CDB Version holds content that strictly follows the CDB standard. 

A CDB Extension corresponds to user defined information, which is not described or supported 
by the CDB standard, stored within the CDB Version. As an example, such additional 
information could be client or vendor-specific information used to increase system performance. 
Any user defined information shall not replace or be used in place of existing CDB information. 
A CDB Extension only contains vendor or device specific information.  

 
Figure 16: UML diagram of the version 

3-8- Configuration  
The CDB Configuration and CDB Version mechanisms allow users to manage the CDB by 
offering the following capabilities: 
● The CDB can have multiple simultaneous independent CDB Configurations. 
● Each CDB Configuration is defined by an ordered list of CDB Versions. 
● A CDB Version is either a collection of CDB Datasets or a collection of user-defined 

datasets called a CDB Extension 
The Configuration metadata file provides the means of defining CDB Configurations. The 
complete XML schema is provided in /CDB/Metadata/Schema/Configuration.xsd delivered with 
the standard and displayed below. 



25 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
Figure 17: UML diagram of configuration metadata 

A single XML file, named Configuration.xml, completely defines the configuration of a CDB. 
This way, the client application does not have to traverse the linked list of CDB Versions 
through the 'PreviousIncrementalRootDirectory' element found in Version.xml. The main 
properties of the configuration metadata UML diagram are documented below.

3-9- CDB Vector Attributes  
The CDB attributes are listed and described in Volume 1: CDB Core section 5.7.1.3 CDB 
Attributes. The metadata for these attributes is stored in \CDB\Metadata\CDB_Attributes.xml 
and the following diagram indicates the schema file as provided in the CDB schema folder, 
Vector_Attributes.xsd. In essence, the file is the transposition of CDB Attributes into a format 
more appropriate for a computer program. 

 
Figure 18: UML diagram of the CDB vector attributes 

The UML diagram is composed of three majors sections (i.e. attributes, units and scalers), the 
first one being the most important. The file has a list of attributes, followed by two lists of units 
and scalers that are referenced by an individual attribute. The main properties of the vector 
attributes’ UML diagram are documented below.

Annex B:  
UML notations 

  

B.1 Class Diagrams Notation 
A class diagram shows a collection of declarative (static) model elements, such as classes, types, 
and their contents and relationships. Classes and relationships represent real-world concepts to 
describe the structure of a system. The CDB Core Standard is presented in this document in 
diagrams using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams. The UML notations used 
in this standard are described here (see ISO TS 19103, Geographic information - Conceptual 
schema language for the details). 
A relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class 
and objects diagrams. UML shows the following relationships: 

Relationships Definition Diagram 

Association 
 

It is semantic relationship between two or more classes that 
specifies links among their instances. In association, an attribute 
of the dependent class is an instance of the independent class. 

 

Aggregation Form of association that specifies a whole-part relationship 
between the aggregate (whole) and a component part.  

 

Composition It is an aggregation and stronger variant of the "has a" 
association relationship; if the container is destroyed, normally 
every instance that it contains is destroyed as well. 

 

Generalization Taxonomic relationship between a more general element and a 
more specific element. It is also known as the inheritance or "is 
a" relationship. The superclass (base class) is also known as the 
"parent".  

Realizations  It is shown on classes, interfaces, components, and packages that 
connects a client element with a supplier element and shows that 
the class realizes the operations offered by the interface. 

 

 

The UML representation of an association is a line with an optional arrowhead indicating the 
role of the object(s) in the relationship, and an optional notation at each end indicating the 
multiplicity (the number of objects that participate in the association) of instances of that entity 
as listed in the below table: 



33 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

0..1 No instances, or one instance 
1, 1..1 Exactly one instance 

0..* Zero or more instances 
n Specific number 

1..* One or more instances 

 

In the document, UML diagrams typically identifies a stereotype with a bracketed comment for 
each object identifying whether it is a class, interface, etc. Additionally, the UMLs are color-
coded as follow to show different stereotypes:
