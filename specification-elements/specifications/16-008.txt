                                i.          Abstract

GeoSciML is a model of geological features commonly described and portrayed in geological maps, cross sections, geological reports and databases.  The model was developed by the IUGS CGI (Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information) and version 4.1 is the first version officially submitted as an OGC standard.  This specification describes a logical model and GML/XML encoding rules for the exchange of geological map data, geological time scales, boreholes, and metadata for laboratory analyses.  It includes a Lite model, used for simple map-based applications; a basic model, aligned on INSPIRE, for basic data exchange; and an extended model to address more complex scenarios.  

The specification also provides patterns, profiles (most notably of Observations and Measurements - ISO19156), and best practices to deal with common geoscience use cases. 

                                ii.          Keywords

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

Ogc doc, OGC document, geology, geoscience, stratigraphy, borehole, geochemistry, geophysics, rock, fault, contact, fold, fossil, UML, GML, XML.

                                iii.          Preface

The primary goal of this specification is to capture the semantics, schema, and encoding syntax of key elements described and portrayed in geological maps and databases, in order to enable information systems to interoperate with such data.

1.    Scope

GeoSciML (Geoscience Markup Language) covers the domain of geology (earth materials, geological units and stratigraphy, geological time, geological structures, geomorphology, geochemistry) and sampling features common to the practice of geoscience, such as boreholes and geological specimens.  The specification also proposes a simplified version of GeoSciML suitable for portrayal of geological features on digital maps.  This specification does not address (or very partially addresses) more specialised geoscience domains such as hydrogeology, seismology, geophysics or economic geology.  Some of these domains are covered by other specifications (e.g. GroundwaterML for hydrogeology; OGC 16-032, and EarthResourceML for economic geology – both developed in concert with GeoSciML).

2.    Conformance

This standard defines a logical model and an XML encoding which conform to OGC GML 3.3 encoding rules, itself, an iteration over ISO 19136 (2007).

Requirements for three standardization target types are considered:

	 Logical Model
	 Encoding
	 Data instance


Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site[1].

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

5.    GeoSciML Models

The GeoSciML 4.1 is an ISO General Feature Model (ISO19101, ISO19109) implementation of portions of the North American Data Model [12] and CSIRO’s XMML model.  GeoSciML also provides models for concepts at the immediate periphery of geological mapping, such as boreholes, geologic specimens and laboratory analysis, modelled as SF_SamplingFeatures and OM_Observations (OGC 10-004r3). 

 

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Model lineage. Geological entities are logical implementations of NADM while sampling and observations entities are implementations of O&M (ISO19156).
			
		
	


	
	

GeoSciML has been through 4 major releases and a few minor releases since 2005.  Each version brought a different interpretation of what is essentially the same conceptual model.  The reader looking at all iterations will see, with few exceptions, the same concepts, the same associations and the same properties, but packaged differently.  GeoSciML increasingly adopted other domain models as it evolved; it replaced XMML (eXploration and Mining Markup Languages, developed by CSIRO) by Observations and Measurements (ISO19156), custom data types for ranges and categories by SWE Common, and removed custom vocabularies to use web resources.

This fourth iteration is essentially a repackaging of the previous version 3.2 from 13 packages organised by themes into 6 packages organised by use cases (Figure 2):

	 GeoSciML Basic: a set of core geologic features, aligned to the INSPIRE Data Specification on Geology.
	 GeoSciML Extension: an extension providing detailed description of basic features which adds additional properties and associations.
	 GeoSciML Geologic Age: a model for the representation of geologic time using procedures adopted by the International Stratigraphic Commission.
	 GeoSciML Borehole: a model for boreholes, including geologic logs and drilling details and other engineering information.
	 GeoSciML Laboratory and Analysis: a model for laboratory analytical metadata, geological sampling and specimens, and isotopic age observation results.
	 GeoSciML Lite: previously known as “GeoSciML Portrayal” in version 3.2; a simplified alternate implementation of the conceptual model for layer based applications.


	
		
		

			
				Figure: : GeoSciML 4.1 packages.
			
		
	


	
	

 Each application package is the subject of at least one requirements class (to conform to the modular specification) per target implementation (this specification has three targets; logical model, encoding and data instance).  More target implementations might be published as separate documents.

5.1    GeoSciML Basic and Extension

GeoSciML describes geological features from the mapping perspective, articulated around the concept of a MappedFeature – the cartographic element shown on a map, and the GeologicFeature it represents.  All geologic concepts that can be represented on a map are subtypes of GeologicFeature.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : High-level model.
			
		
	


	
	

GeologicFeature is an abstract class materialised into four concrete classes (Figure 4) - GeologicEvent, GeologicStructure, GeologicUnit and GeomorphologicFeature.   The other main features of the GeoSciML model are not geologic features themselves, but features related to the activity of sampling and observing geology (such as Borehole or GeologicSpecimen) and are therefore modelled as SF_SamplingFeature (O&M) subtypes.

GeologicFeature can share arbitrary relationships through a relation class (AbstractRelation), subtyped into different kind of relationships, providing distinct properties and constraints.

In order to provide a simple entry level model for data providers, but also to align to INSPIRE, only a minimal set of properties are supported by the basic package.  When more properties are required, the data provider can use the extension package.  To split properties between basic and extension, a modelling pattern has been adopted to overcome the limitations of classical object oriented subtyping imposed by UML and XSD.

5.1.1    AbstractDescription classes

The technique to add extended properties to an existing class is normally to create a subtype to carry the new properties (Figure 5).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Adding properties by extension.
			
		
	


	
	

But this only works when properties need to be added to a leaf class.  Properties added by subtyping a class higher up in the chain of inheritance will create a new branch, and new properties won’t propagate to existing subtypes in the main branch. GeoSciML 4 adopts an extension pattern using abstract property blocks or ‘AbstractDescription’ classes (Figure 6).  Blocks of extended properties are organized in their own Datatype, subtyping AbstractDescription.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Extension pattern using a property block (AbstractDescription class).
			
		
	


	
	

This pattern has two main advantages:

	 It does not require the creation of a new feature type to add properties to core features.
	 Extra properties can be defined and used by other user communities (e.g., properties added by a geophysical application could be reused by groundwater applications).


GeoSciML Basic contains nine stub AbstractDescription classes ultimately materialised in GeoSciML Extension (Table 1).

Since those classes are abstract in GeoSciML Basic, data providers need to implement GeoSciML Extension, or any third party extension to get concrete classes.

This modelling pattern is also used by other standards communities (e.g., ISO 19115-3).

5.2    GeoSciML Lite

GeoSciML Lite is a denormalised view, or a transformation, of key geological and sampling features, designed as a simple entry-level model to publish datasets, particularly adapted to geographic visualization with key reporting properties.  The use case for GeoSciML Lite is a simple layer-based application; such as web map application or GIS where the key functionality is to display a map layer and perform simple identify or query operations.  The classes are modelled to be easily implementable in any GIS or web mapping application.  One feature type maps to one table composed of optional, single-occurrence properties – consistent with the structure of denormalised RDBMS tables.  The XML implementation (clause 9.8) is conformant with GML Simple Feature (OGC 10-100r3).

Each property of GeoSciML Lite classes is derived from a subset of the properties available in the full GeoSciML model, with the exception of “genericSymbolizer”, which is a convenience property providing a cartographic symbol or code. The property is a shortcut to symbolisation that would otherwise be provided by an SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor).

Some fields are external references, in the form of HTTP URI, to provide hyperlinks for applications to access linked data definitions to externally governed vocabulary terms and/or complex representations of the features when required.

6.    Conventions

6.1    Requirement class

Each normative statement (requirement or recommendation) in this specification is a member of a requirements class. Each requirements class is described in a discrete clause or sub-clause, and summarized using the following template:

	
  Requirements class
  	
  /req/{classM}
  
	
  Target type

  	
  [artefact or technology type]

  
	
  Dependency

  	
  [identifier for another requirements class]

  
	
  Requirement

  	
  /req/{classM}/{reqN}

  
	
  Recommendation

  	
  /req/{classM}/{recO}

  
	
  Requirement

  	
  /req/{classM}/{reqP}

  
	
  Requirement
  /Recommendation

  	
  [repeat as necessary]

  



All requirements in a requirements class must be satisfied. Hence, the requirements class is the unit of re-use and dependency, and the value of a dependency requirement is another requirements class. All requirements in a dependency must also be satisfied by a conforming implementation. A requirements class may consist only of dependencies and introduce no new requirements.

6.2    Requirement and Recommendation

All requirements and recommendations are normative, and each is presented using the following template:

	
  Requirement /req/[classM]/[reqN]
  
	
  [Normative statement]

  



 

where /req/[classM]/[reqN] identifies the requirement or recommendation. The use of this layout convention allows the normative provisions of this specification to be easily located by implementers.

6.3    Conformance class

Conformance to this specification is possible at a number of levels, specified by conformance classes (Annex A). Each conformance class is summarized using the following template:

	
  Conformance class
  
	
  /conf/{classM}
  
	
  Dependency

  	
  [identifier for
  another conformance class]

  
	
  Requirements

  	
  /req/{classA}

  
	
  Tests

  	
  [reference to
  clause(s) containing tests]

  



All tests in a class must be passed. Each conformance class tests conformance to a set of requirements packaged in a requirements class.

W3C Schema (XSD) and ISO Schematron (SCH) files are considered as part of this specification, although available online only, due to concerns about document size. Many requirements are expressed in a single XSD or SCH file, although tests are listed individually in the conformance annex (one test for XSD and one test for SCH). 

Schematron files explicitly specify which requirements are being tested in the title of the schematron pattern.



<pattern id="unit-of-measure">
    <title>Test requirement: /req/gsml4xsd/unit-of-measure</title>
    <rule context="SWE::Quantity">
        <assert test="SWE::Quantity">Quantity must have a UOM</assert>
    </rule>
</pattern>



6.4    Identifiers

The normative provisions in this specification are denoted by a URI constructed using this pattern:




http://www.opengis.net/spec/{standard}/{m.n}



All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by a partial URI which is relative to this base. The identifier supports cross-referencing of class membership, dependencies, and links from each conformance test to the requirements tested. In this specification identifiers are expressed as partial URIs or paths, which can be appended to a base URI that identifies the specification as a whole in order to construct a complete URI for identification in an external context.

The URI for each requirements class has the form:




http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosciml/4.1/req/[classM].



The URI for each requirement or recommendation has the form:




http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosciml/4.1/req/[classM]/[reqN].



The URI for each conformance class has the form:




http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosciml/4.1/conf/[classM].



The URI for each conformance test has the form:




http://www.opengis.net/spec/geosciml/4.1/conf/[classM]/[testN].



6.5    Classifiers

This document contains a large number of references to classifiers that might sometimes be ambiguous.  Classes and packages are simply referred by their name formed using “CamelCase” name in mono space type.  Duplicate names do exist and the scope (the package of a class or the class a property belongs to) must be made explicit. 

OCL syntax will be used to identify a logical model classifier from the UML model.

Package::{…}Package::Classifier::Property:Type

Package names are not formal in UML and can change from one implementation to another.  The reference model used by GeoSciML, and several other domain models, is HollowWorld.  For example, a complete path for a SF_SamplingPoint in HollowWorld (from HollowWorld root) is

ISO TC211::ISO 19156 All::ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements::Sampling Features::samplingPoint::SF_SamplingPoint

For the sake of readability, and also because some HollowWorld package names do not have OCL friendly names (e.g. some package names contain ‘:’, as shown in the previous example), this document will use shortcuts to identify packages.  For example, for OM::SF_SamplingPoint, OM acts as a shortcut for (ISO TC211::ISO 19156 All::ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements::*) that includes all classifiers in all sub packages and avoids creating a shortcut for all sub packages.  The list of shortcuts is provided in Section 8.1.2.  GeoSciML also uses the recently published ISO19115-3 model which has numerous classifier name overlaps with ISO19115 from HollowWorld.

W3C XPath will be used in XML instances.  XML entities will be identified using their full qualified name (namespace, identified by its prefix, and entity name).

	gsmlb:GeologicUnit refers to an instance of GeologicUnit, from namespace xmlns:gsmlb="http://www.opengis.net/gsml/4.1/GeoSciML-Basic"
	gsmlb:GeologicUnit/gml:name refers to the name property of GeologicUnit
	gsmlb:GeologicUnit/gml:name/@codeName refers to the codeName attribute of the name property of GeologicUnit


7.    Conceptual Model

The strictly geological portion of GeoSciML, as opposed to the parts dealing with sampling (e.g., boreholes) and laboratory metadata, is largely an implementation of the North American Data Model [12].  NADM is a technologically neutral conceptual model that addresses geoscience concepts and the relationships between them.  GeoSciML 4 does not implement NADM Geologic Portrayal (a model of cartographic elements composing a geological map, such as legends, symbols, insets, etc.) nor Geologic Vocabulary (although older versions of GeoSciML did).

GeoSciML is an ISO Feature Model implementation of NADM and this created subtle differences between NADM and GeoSciML as the logical model deals with ISO Feature Model idiosyncrasies.  For instance, NADM multiple inheritances used in Fossil could not be implemented in the ISO world that forbids such constructs.  There were also conceptual changes, especially regarding EarthMaterial that is not considered as a GeologicFeature (hence an ISO FeatureType) in GeoSciML, but as a Type.

Sampling and analytical metadata features (Borehole and GeologicSpecimen in particular) are extensions of Observations and Measurements (10-004r3) and as such implement the underlying Observations and Measurements conceptual model.  Borehole introduces engineering concepts known to the industry without a formal conceptual model.  It has been recognised that Boreholes are features that are common outside the geological mapping realms (like the energy and mineral resources industries, hydrogeology, civil engineering, etc) and more formal work could be carried by those interested parties.  Therefore, Borehole in GeoSciML is a essentially placeholder waiting to be replaced by a more formal Borehole model that is applicable across more domains than geology. It is expected that the Laboratory Analysis model could also be formalised by parties interested in (geo)chemical analysis.

  components.

  



Target logical models that are compliant with the conceptual model shall implement components of the conceptual model respecting their semantics, i.e. their definition and intent. In other words, the logical model must be highly semantically similar to components of the conceptual model. Semantic similarity can be tested in multiple ways, including but not limited to: (i) direct comparison of UML components, (ii) comparison after mapping components to a common expressive knowledge representation language, such as first order logic or common logic, or (iii) comparison after mapping components to a reference ontology. The target can reuse and adapt existing logical models.

8.    Logical Model

This section describes requirements that must be met by all target implementations that claim conformance to this specification.  The target implementation of the logical model is generally an encoding specification or a schema (which could use technologies like XSD, for example) and not a data instance.  The logical model, expressed using UML, provides naming, structure and cardinality for any physical implementation.  The UML model is a normative artefact as the official representation of GeoSciML.  Rules that can be unambiguously inferred from the UML model will not be documented as explicit requirements.  Specific encoding idiosyncrasies shall be addressed in the requirement clauses pertaining to that encoding.

The logical model contains almost no semantic requirements (i.e., vocabularies, enumerations).  It is expected that users will employ controlled vocabularies of terms which are developed by user communities.  The model provides mechanisms for delivering concepts from controlled vocabularies via URI’s and linked data principles.

8.1    UML Model

The UML model provides name, structure and cardinality for data elements composing various potential physical implementations of GeoSciML.  There are formal mappings between UML and GML (ISO-19136), UML and RDF (ISO-19150) and best practices exist for mapping UML to RDBMS.  Although it is assumed that UML is technologically neutral, in reality UML models always end up addressing some of the encoding specification details.  The current GeoSciML UML model has been designed as a GML application according to ISO 19109 and borrows some of artefacts of GML. Several design decisions were guided by limitations of UML (e.g. single inheritance) and XSD (package dependencies artefacts) and some constraints of GML delivery using ISO19142 WFS (for instance, some XSD encodings are not queryable easily with ISO19143 FES).  However, the UML model is detailed enough to constrain the main elements of any encoding; the names of entities and the cardinality of properties, the associations between entities and to some extent property types.  On the other hand, some UML features do not have equivalences in certain encoding (for instance, JSON does not have a native support for namespaces or even schema).

Figure 8 shows requirements class dependencies:

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Logical Model Requirements classes dependencies (external dependencies not shown)
			
		
	


	
	

This section defines the minimum UML mapping requirements that shall be met by any target claiming compliance to this specification.

8.1.1    Property cardinality

All properties that could feasibly be made optional are optional in GeoSciML 4.1.  This is a reversal of the pattern used in GeoSciML version 3.2 where all properties were made mandatory, forcing the data provider to document why the property was missing using nillable properties.  This design attracted a lot of criticism (not only for GeoSciML but for other communities confronted with the same pattern) from application developers and data providers that consider filling the instance with nil properties is “unnecessarily verbose” and a waste of bandwidth.  It has been argued that nillable properties are just verbose absent values.  This issue is a real concern for mobile applications where payload has an impact on user experience.

Nillable properties actually carry useful or even required information in certain use cases, such as legally bounded data exchange scenarios.  Some communities using GeoSciML may still want to force usage of nillable properties and the SWG recognised that different communities might want to enforce the use of some properties for their particular needs.  To meet this requirement and to offer flexibility to various communities wanting to use (or extend) GeoSciML, properties are optional, but can still be nilled.  A data provider is offered two options when a value is missing:

	Omit the property
	Deliver a nilled property with relevant justification.


Which option is most useful for a community is left to that community to decide.  Their decision can be enforced using Schematron.  The editors foresee the use of a) the GeoSciML data model as defined by this specification providing naming and structure and b) a series of community-defined rules to enforce the presence of certain properties relevant to their use cases.  For an XML implementation, this translates into a set of common XSD and SCH to govern conformance to GeoSciML, and community-specific SCH to enforce specific use cases, such as the INSPIRE geology specification [8].

  value as equal to that single value.

  
	
  Requirement

  	
  /req/gsml4-core/codelist

  Empty classes with
  stereotype <<CodeList>> SHALL be implemented as externally
  governed vocabularies which terms are encoded as URI (RFC 3986).

  



This section presents requirements to which all target encodings must conform in to order to claim compliance to GeoSciML 4.1.

8.2.1    Naming of entities

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/uml-entity-name
  
	
  When
  the target implementation allows it, the exact name of the classifier SHALL be
  used.

  



If a target implementation is capable of encoding all the artefacts (classes and properties) using the same names used in UML, it shall do so.  Some target implementations might prevent it; for example, dBase (DBF files) column names are restricted to 10 characters or some RDBMS limits the use of camel case names.  But if the target allows it, the exact names shall be used.

8.2.2    Cardinality

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/uml-cardinality
  
	
  If
  the target implementation allows it, it SHALL implement the same cardinality
  of properties and associations as defined in the UML.

  



Cardinality shall be the same as defined in UML model.  Since essentially all properties are optional, this clause addresses the upper bounds of cardinality: “1” or “many” in almost all cases.  Therefore, if the UML model limits a property’s maximum cardinality to “1”, then the target implementation cardinality cannot be “many”.

8.2.3    Abstract classes

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/uml-abstract
  
	
  Abstract
  classes SHALL NOT be materialised.

  



 

Not all physical implementations support the concept of an abstract class, or even inheritance and polymorphism.  XSD does support that concept and all its implications, but JSON does not – although JavaScript can somewhat.  This requirement specifies that the encoding specification shall not allow materialisation of an instance of a class stereotyped as abstract.

8.2.4    Polymorphism

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/uml-polymorphism
  
	
  A target
  implementation SHALL implement type substitutions inferred from the UML model.

  



The type hierarchy of the UML model implies type substitutions for property values.  For instance, a property value of type GeologicEvent can be substituted by a value of type DisplacementEvent because DisplacementEvent is a subtype of GeologicEvent.  Many property types are abstract types and only a concrete subtype may be materialised (as per /req/gsml4-core/uml-abstract).  A target implementation shall consider type substitutions using mechanisms available for this implementation.

8.2.5    Quantities

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/quantities-uom
  
	
  Quantities
  and measurements SHALL have explicit units of measure from a governed ontology.

  



The quantities and measurements units of measure shall be taken from a standard vocabulary governed by an appropriate community, for example the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM).

8.2.6    QuantityRange

A QuantityRange is a quantity formed of a lower and upper value forming a range of values.  If a single value needs to be represented as a QuantityRange, where the single value is assigned to both lower and upper properties.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/quantities-single-range
  

	
  QuantityRange
  properties that must report a single value SHALL assign both lower and upper
  value as equal to that single value.

  



8.2.7    Code lists

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-core/codelist
  
	
  Empty
  classes with stereotype <<CodeList>> SHALL be implemented as externally governed vocabularies
  which terms are encoded as URI (RFC 3986).

  



All properties that require formal vocabularies are modelled in the UML as classes having the stereotype <<CodeList>>.  The list of valid terms is either prescribed by this specification, with a list of possible entries (Figure 9) or open (i.e., without any terms).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Example CodeLists, with a) a prescribed list of terms (DescriptionPurpose) and b) “open” with no prescribed terms (GeologicUnitHierarchyRoleTerm)
			
		
	


	
	

When the list is open, the vocabulary is managed externally over the web where each vocabulary term should be encoded as a resource.  Vocabulary term identifiers are URIs representing concepts from a standard vocabulary governed by an appropriate community - for example, the IUGS CGI Geoscience Terminology Working Group (http://www.cgi-iugs.org/tech_collaboration/geoscience_terminology_working_group.html and http://resource.geosciml.org) or INSPIRE [8].

This requirement does not require that URIs be actually dereferenceable, but just that a vocabulary term is associated with a syntactically correct URI.

  SHALL be to one or more representations of that entity.

  Dereferenceable
  HTTP URI used as identifiers SHOULD provide GeoSciML 4.1 as one of its
  representations.

  
	
  Requirement

  	
  /req/gsml4-lod/byref

  External references to an entity conforming
  to [/req/gsml4-lod/identifier] shall be expressed using this entity
  identifier.

  



Although OGC standards are not restricted to a web environment, they are strongly influenced by this environment.  GeoSciML was originally developed specifically for XML, but many other encodings are suitable hypermedia formats (RDF/XML, JSON-LD, HTML).  This requirements class describes extra rules that shall be implemented to turn GeoSciML data instances into hypermedia compatible with Linked Open Data principles.

Linked Open Data is a method to publish structured data on the web.  It leverages existing web technologies such as HTTP (transfer protocol) and URI (addressing over the web) to connect structured resources.  The principle is similar to interconnected web pages through hyperlinks, except that pages are replace with structured information that can be processed by machines.

The following requirements essentially impose that URI used as vocabulary, identifiers and references can be “dereferenced”, which is “The act of retrieving a representation of a resource identified by a URI”[2] from the web.  A resource can have multiple representations (GML, XML, RDF, etc.) and this specification does not impose a particular one, although it is common sense in this context to provide a GeoSciML representation for geological features.

It is important to note that a HTTP URI in this context is both an identifier and a location.  The same identifier is used to refer to any number of representations.  Therefore, different representations are selected through content negotiation with the server.

8.3.1    Code lists URI

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lod/codelistURI
  
	
  URI used for vocabulary
  terms SHALL be dereferenceable to one or more representations of the
  vocabulary term.

  



The requirement described at 8.2.7  in Abstract Requirements Class demand that a vocabulary reference be encoded as a URI, but does not require that the URI actually resolve to anything (it could, but it is not required).  In this class, the target must ensure that the URI used to identify vocabulary terms SHALL dereference to one or more representations of a definition of the term (eg, RDF/SKOS, HTML, GML Definition, etc.)

8.3.2    Identifier

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lod/identifier
  
	
  HTTP URI used as entity
  identifiers SHALL be to one or more representations of that entity.

  



This requirement demands that the target ensures that a data instance exposes a URI as a unique identifier for this feature and this identifier SHALL be dereferenceable to one or more representations of that feature.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lod/gsml-representation
  
	
  Dereferenceable HTTP URI
  used as identifiers SHOULD provide GeoSciML 4.1 as one of its
  representations.

  



It is expected that one of the representations should be a XML (GML) or any GeoSciML compliant representations, including any profiles derived from this specification.

8.3.3    ByReference associations

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lod/byref
  
	
  External references to an
  entity conforming to [/req/gsml4-lod/identifier] shall be expressed using
  this entity identifier.

  



Serialization of a dataset will often omit the full description of a feature and replace the property value with an external reference.  A reference to this feature is formed by the dereferenceable identifier described in clause 8.3.2. A client ingesting the dataset can use this reference to extract a feature representation if need be.  Over the web, this reference shall be a HTTP URI that can be dereferenced to one or more representations of that feature.

Basic package provides a collection of classes representing fundamental geological and geomorphological features (units, structures, and events), earth materials, geologic time, and the relations between them.  It limits the number of descriptive properties to match important common use cases, including the INSPIRE geological theme specification [8].

8.4.1    Geology Basic

GeologyBasic is a package of classes representing fundamental geological map features and the relations between them.  GeoSciML describes a geologic dataset as a series of GeologicFeature occurrences, spatially represented as MappedFeature.  A map is a collection of MappedFeatures.  The term “map”, typically understood as a map sheet (a given area on the surface of the earth), is only one of the possible collection of MappedFeatures.  Other examples are cross-sections, block diagrams, and even borehole logs (a linear map).  MappedFeature can represent any features and GeologicFeatures are one of the kinds of features it can represent.  A MappedFeature identifies what it represents using its “specification” association. 

Figure 11 shows the fundamental relationships between a MappedFeature and the GeologicFeature.  GeologicFeature is further subtyped into GeologicUnit, GeologicStructure, GeomorphologicFeature and GeologicEvent.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Geologic Feature and MappedFeature.
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.1.1    GeologicFeature

The abstract GeologicFeature class represents a conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the world.  It corresponds with a “legend item” from a traditional geologic map and its instance acts as the “description package”.  The description package is classified according to its intended purpose as a typicalNorm, definingNorm or instance.  GeologicFeature can be used outside the context of a map (it can lack a MappedFeature), for example when describing typical norms (describing expected property from a feature) or defining norms (describing properties required from a feature to be classifying in a group, such as given geologic unit).  A GeologicFeature appearing on a map is considered as an “instance”.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Geologic Feature context diagram
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.1.1.1    observationMethod

The GeologicFeature observationMethod (SWE::Category) specifies the approach to acquiring the collection of attribute values that constitute an individual feature instance (e.g. point count, brunton compass on site, air photo interpretation, field observation, hand specimen, laboratory, aerial photography, creative imagination).

ObservationMethod is a convenience property that provides a simple approach to observation metadata when data are reported using a feature view (as opposed to observation view).  This property corresponds (loosely) to ISO19115 Lineage.

8.4.1.1.2    purpose

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/geologicfeature-purpose
  
	
  Purpose
  SHALL be a value from Table 2 of clause 8.4.1.1.2 .

  



 

The property purpose:DescriptionPurpose specifies the intended purpose/level of abstraction for a given feature or object instance.  The possible values are: instance, typicalNorm, and definingNorm.

Table : Valid “purpose” values	
  Purpose
  	
  Description
  
	
  instance

  	
  And instance is a description that is
  specific to a particular observed occurrence. This is 'raw data', and its
  classification may start out as very general. There are kinds of narrowly
  defined ControlledConcepts that might not allow 'instances' that are
  different from the DefiningNorm. It might be worth considering a different
  relationship between MappedFeature and an Instance GeologicEntity, with the
  GeologicEntity role being 'description'.

  
	
  typicalNorm

  	
  A typicalNorm is a description that
  specifies properties to be expected of some occurrence associated with the
  GeologicEntity. This description may include many properties that are not
  part of the DefiningNorm. For example, the fact that granite is typically
  light-colored is not a defining property, but is certainly a useful typical
  property. These kinds of descriptions would be used to address queries like
  'This area is within a polygon classified as Podunk Formation; what sort of
  lithology am I most likely to encounter when I start digging?' The Podunk
  Formation may be defined by the presence of a certain ammonite... TypicalNorm
  description would be constructed as a summary over many Instance
  descriptions.

  
	
  definingNorm

  	
  A defining norm is a description that
  specifies properties sufficient to identify a new occurrence as belonging to
  the class represented by the description. Basically these are the 'sufficient
  conditions' for class membership. Used when presented with a query 'I have an
  outcrop with these properties; which geologic unit should I assign to the
  outcrop?' DefiningNorm has to do with the intension of a ControlledConcept.

  



8.4.1.1.3    classifier

The classifier (SWE::Category) contains a standard description or definition of the feature type (e.g., the definition of a particular geologic unit in a stratigraphic lexicon).

8.4.1.1.4    occurrence

The occurrence property is an association that links a notional geologic feature with any number of mapped features (MappedFeature).  A geologic feature, such as a geologic unit may be linked to mapped features from a number of different maps.

8.4.1.1.5    geologicHistory

The geologicHistory is an association that relates one or more GeologicEvents to a GeologicFeature to describe their age or geologic history.  Normally, GeoSciML uses the generic relatedFeature::GeologicRelation to associate GeologicFeature with other GeologicFeatures, including GeologicEvent.  However, this design was deemed too complex for GeoSciML Basic and is therefore only available from the GeoSciML Extension package. 

To avoid extra complexity, GeoSciML Basic provides an explicit geologicHistory property to associate GeologicFeature with a GeologicEvent without using a GeologicRelation.  The consequence for someone using GeoSciML Extension is that she/he is now offered two ways to link a GeologicFeature and GeologicEvent: through geologicHistory and through a generic GeologicRelation.  User communities should define a pattern that suit their needs.

8.4.1.1.6    relatedFeature (stub property)

A relatedFeature is a general structure used to define relationships between any features or objects within GeoSciML. Relationships are always binary and directional.  There is always a single source and a single target for a given FeatureRelation (which is abstract in GeoSciML Basic).  The relationship is always defined from the perspective of the Source and is generally an active verb. 

In GeoSciML Basic, relatedFeature is a stub association (see clause 5.1.1).   However some encodings (such as XML) will allow a “by reference” value (for example xlink:href) to an external instance.

8.4.1.2    MappedFeature

A MappedFeature is part of a geological interpretation. It provides a link between a notional feature (description package) and one spatial representation of it, or part of it (exposures, surface traces and intercepts, etc.).  The mapped features are the elements that compose a map, a cross-section, a borehole log, or any other representation.  The mappingFrame identifies the domain being mapped by the geometries.  For typical geological maps, the mapping frame is the surface of the earth (the 2.5D interface between the surface of the bedrock and whatever sits on it; atmosphere or overburden material for bedrock maps).  It can also be abstract frames, such as the arbitrary plane that forms a mine level or a cross-section, the 3D volume enclosing an ore body or the line that approximate the path of a borehole.

The specification association identifies what notional feature is being mapped.  It can be any features and is not restricted to GeoSciML feature, although it is expected to be for geological maps.

The observationMethod property (SWE::Category) contains an element in a list of categories (a controlled vocabulary) describing how the spatial extent of the mapped feature was determined.

8.4.1.2.1    positionalAccuracy

The positionalAccuracy property (SWE::Quantity) provides a quantitative value defining the radius of an uncertainty buffer around a MappedFeature (e.g., a positionalAccuracy of 100 m for a line feature defines a buffer polygon of total width 200 m centred on the line).  The property is equivalent to ISO19115 DQ_PositionalAccuracy.

8.4.1.2.2    resolutionRepresentativeFraction

The property resolutionRepresentativeFraction:Integer is an integer value representing the denominator of the representative scale of the spatial feature.  (i.e., 10000 = the spatial feature is intended to be represented at 1:10,000 scale).

8.4.1.2.3    mappingFrame

The mappingFrame:MappingFrameTerm provides a term from a vocabulary indicating the geometric frame on which the MappedFeature is projected.  In most situations, mapped features are projected on the earth surface, but there are other contexts, such as a bedrock surface beneath surficial cover materials, a mine level, or a cross section.

8.4.1.2.4    exposure

The exposure:ExposureTerm property provides a term for the nature of the expression of the mapped feature at the earth’s surface (e.g., exposed, concealed).

8.4.1.2.5    shape

The shape:GM_Object property contains the geometry delimiting the mapped feature.  Note that while in most cases, the geometry will be a 2D polygon, it is not restricted to any dimension.  For instance, a lithological log can be represented using of 1D geometries (expressed linearly from the borehole origin), or a geologic unit can be represented using a 3D volume.

8.4.1.2.6    specification

The specification association links an instance of MappedFeature to the GFI_Feature being mapped. In a geological map, MappedFeatures are used to represent GeologicFeatures, but other features from other domains could be represented.

8.4.1.3    GeologicUnit

Conceptually, a GeologicUnit may represent a body of material in the Earth whose complete and precise extent is inferred to exist (e.g., North American Data Model GeologicUnit [12], Stratigraphic unit in the sense of NACSN [14], or International Stratigraphic Code [9]), or a classifier used to characterize parts of the Earth (e.g. lithologic map unit like ‘granitic rock’ or ‘alluvial deposit’, surficial units like ‘till’ or ‘old alluvium’). It includes both formal units (i.e. formally adopted and named in an official lexicon) and informal units (i.e. named but not promoted to a lexicon) and unnamed units (i.e., recognizable, described and delineable in the field but not otherwise formalised).  In simpler terms, a geologic unit is a package of earth material (generally rock).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : GeologicUnit context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

Operationally, a GeologicUnit is a container used to associate geologic properties with some mapped occurrence (through the GeologicFeature::occurrence::MappedFeature link), or with a geologic unit via a vocabulary (through the GeologicUnit::classifier).

Spatial properties are only available through association with a MappedFeature (although GeologicUnit do have a boundedBy property inherited from GFI_Feature).

8.4.1.3.1    geologicUnitType

The property geologicUnitType:GeologicUnitTypeTerm provides a term from a controlled vocabulary defining the type of geologic unit. Logical constraints of definition of unit and valid property cardinalities should be contained in the definition. Use of the CGI Geologic Unit Type vocabulary (e.g., http://resource.geosciml.org/classifierscheme/cgi/201211/geologicunittype) is recommended.

8.4.1.3.2    rank

The property rank:RankTerm contains a term that classifies the geologic unit in a generalization hierarchy from most local/smallest volume to most regional/largest.

Examples: group, subgroup, formation, member, bed, intrusion, complex, batholith

8.4.1.3.3    hierarchyLink

The property hierarchyLink is an association that links a GeologicUnit with a GeologicUnitHierarchy (8.4.1.4) to represent containment of a part GeologicUnit within another GeologicUnit. It indicates a subsidiary unit with its role and proportion with respect to the container unit.  For example, members are described as part of formations, or different facies can be described as parts of a GeologicUnit.

8.4.1.3.4    composition

The property composition is an association that links a GeologicUnit with CompositionParts to describe the material composition of the GeologicUnit (e.g., a detailed, instance specific, lithologic description)

8.4.1.3.5    gbMaterialDescription (stub property)

The property gbMaterialDescription:EarthMaterialAbstractDescription is a placeholder that provides detailed material description.  This is a stub property (See 5.1.1) in GeoSciML Basic as EarthMaterialAbstractDescription is abstract with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension. 

8.4.1.3.6    gbUnitDescription (stub property)

The property gbUnitDescription:GeologicUnitAbstractDescriptio is a placeholder that provides detailed material description.  This is a stub property (See 5.1.1) in GeoSciML Basic as GeologicUnitAbstractDescription is abstract with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension. 

8.4.1.4    GeologicUnitHierarchy

GeologicUnitHierarchy associates a GeologicUnit with another GeologicUnit that is a proper part of that unit. Parts may be formal or notional. Formal parts refer to a specific body of rock, as in formal stratigraphic members. Notional parts refer to assemblages of particular EarthMaterials with particular internal structure, which may be repeated in various places within a unit (e.g. ‘turbidite sequence’, ‘point bar assemblage’, ‘leucosome veins’). 

8.4.1.4.1    role

The role:GeologicUnitHierarchyRoleTerm property provides a term describing the nature of the parts, e.g. facies, stratigraphic, interbeds, geographic, eastern facies.

8.4.1.4.2    proportion

The proportion property (SWE::QuantityRange) provides a quantity that represents the fraction of the geologic unit formed by the part.

8.4.1.4.3    targetUnit

The property targetUnit is an association that specifies exactly one GeologicUnit that is a proper part of another GeologicUnit.

8.4.1.5    CompositionPart

CompositionPart represents the composition of a geologic unit in terms of earth material constituents (CompoundMaterial).  It decomposes the material making of the unit into parts having distinct roles and proportions.

8.4.1.5.1    role

The property role:CompositionPartRoleTerm defines the relationship of the CompoundMaterial constituent in the geologic unit, e.g. vein, interbedded constituent, layers, dominant constituent.

8.4.1.5.2    proportion

The proportion property (SWE::QuantityRange) specifies the fraction of the geologic unit composed of the compound material. 

8.4.1.5.3    Material

The material:EarthMaterial property contains the material description (8.4.1.6) of the composing part.

8.4.1.6    EarthMaterial

The EarthMaterial class holds a description of a naturally occurring substance in the Earth.  EarthMaterial represents material composition or substance, and is thus independent of quantity or location. Ideally, EarthMaterials are defined strictly based on physical properties, but because of standard geological usage, genetic interpretations enter into the description as well.  

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : EarthMaterial and related classes.
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.1.6.1    color

The color property (SWE::Category) is a term from a controlled vocabulary that specifies the colour of the earth material. Color schemes such as the Munsell rock and soil color schemes [11] may be used.

8.4.1.6.2    purpose

The purpose:DescriptionPurpose property provides a specification of the intended purpose or level of abstraction for the given EarthMaterial. The intent is the same a GeologicFeature’s purpose (see 8.4.1.1.2) and it shares the same vocabulary (instance, typicalNorm, definingNorm).

8.4.1.6.3    gbEarthMaterialDescription (stub property)

The property gbEarthMaterialDescription:EarthMaterialAbstractDescription provides a detailed earth material description of the part.  This property is a stub in GeoSciML Basic as EarthMaterialAbstractDescription is abstract with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.1.7    CompoundMaterial

A CompoundMaterial is an EarthMaterial composed of particles made of EarthMaterials, possibly including other CompoundMaterials.  This class is provided primarily as an extensibility point for related domain models that wish to import and build on GeoSciML, and wish to define material types that are compound but are not rock or rock-like material. In the context of GeoSciML "RockMaterial" should be used to describe units made of rock. 

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Context diagram for CompoundMaterial
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.1.8    RockMaterial

RockMaterial is a specialized CompoundMaterial that includes consolidated and unconsolidated materials (such as surficial sediments) as well as mixtures of consolidated and unconsolidated materials.  In GeoSciML Basic, Rock Material is essentially a link to a controlled vocabulary (lithology property) and a color (inherited from EarthMaterial).  Specific material properties (and CompoundMaterial nesting) are available in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.1.8.1    lithology

The lithology:LithologyTerm property provides a term identifying the lithology class from a controlled vocabulary.

8.4.2    Geologic Event

Geologic Event is a package of classes to describe identifiable events during which one or more geological processes act to modify geological entities. A GeologicEvent has a specified geologic age and may have specified environments and processes.  Traditionally, geologists have described the age of a feature without explicitly specifying the event or processes the age relates to (age of a pluton is implicitly the age of the crystallization event). The GeologicEvent class allows explicit documentation of the process and environment.

GeologicalHistory is an ordered aggregation of GeologicalEvent objects, each of which may have an associated geological age, geological environment, and one or more geological process.

The age attributes are representations of a particular geological event or feature expressed as absolute age in terms of years (numericAge) before present or named time periods in the geological time scale (youngerNamedAge and olderNamedAge), or by comparison with other geological events or features (relative age).  An event age can represent an instant in time, an interval of time, or any combination of multiple instants or intervals.

Specifications of age in years before present are based on determination of time durations based on interpretation of isotopic analyses of EarthMaterial (some other methods are used for geologically young materials). Ages specified by geological time scales are essentially based on correlation of a geological unit with a standard chronostratigraphic unit that serves as a reference. Relative ages are based on relationships between geological units such as superposition, intruded by, cross-cuts, or “contains inclusions of” (a.k.a, Steno laws [17]).

 

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Geologic Event summary diagram. 
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.2.1    GeologicEvent

A GeologicEvent is an identifiable event during which one or more geological processes act to modify geological entities.  It may have a specified geologic age (numeric age or GeochologicEraTerm) and may have specified environments and processes. An example might be a cratonic uplift event during which erosion, sedimentation, and volcanism all take place.

Because associated processes are incompatible, a single event cannot be shared between DisplacementEvent, AlterationDescription of MetamorphicDescription (a process associated to DisplacementEvent does not apply to AlterationDescription). 

 

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/geologicevent-single
  
	
  An
  individual event GeologicEvent SHALL only apply to one of DisplacementEvent, AlterationDescription or MetamorphicDescription.

  



A geologic event must at least have one age representation, either numerical or named. 

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/geologicevent-non-null
  
	
  Either
  (olderNamedAge + youngerNamedAge) or numericAge SHALL not be null.

  



8.4.2.1.1    eventProcess

The eventProcess:EventProcessTerm property provides a term from a controlled vocabulary specifying the process or processes that occurred during the event. Examples include deposition, extrusion, intrusion, cooling.

8.4.2.1.2    numericAge

The numericAge:NumericAgeRange property provides an age in absolute year before present (BP).  Present is defined by convention to be January 1st 1950 (although van der Plitch & Hogg [20], suggests this convention to be restricted to radiocarbon estimations).

8.4.2.1.3    olderNamedAge

The property olderNamedAge:GeochronologicalEraTerm defines the older boundary of age of an event expressed using a geochronologic era defined according to a geologic time scale as per the GeologicTime schema (eg, the International Commission on Stratigraphy Chronostratigraphic Chart - http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale).

8.4.2.1.4    youngerNamedAge

The property youngerNamedAge:GeochronologicalEraTerm defines the younger boundary of age of event expressed using a geochronologic era defined according to a geologic time scale per the GeologicTime schema. (eg, the International Commission on Stratigraphy Chronostratigraphic Chart - http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale).

8.4.2.1.5    eventEnvironment

The eventEnvironment property (SWE::Category) is a category from a controlled vocabulary identifying the physical setting within which a GeologicEvent takes place. Event environment is construed broadly to include physical settings on the Earth surface specified by climate, tectonics, physiography or geography, and settings in the Earth’s interior specified by pressure, temperature, chemical environment, or tectonics.

8.4.2.1.6    geEventDescription (stub property)

The property geEventDescription:GeologicEventAbstractDescription contains a detailed event description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since GeologicEventAbstractDescription is abstract and with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.2.2    NumericAgeRange

The NumericAgeRange class represents an absolute age assignment using numeric measurement results.

8.4.2.2.1    reportingDate

The reportingDate (SWE::Quantity) property reports a single time coordinate value to report as representative for this NumericAge assignment.

8.4.2.2.2    olderBoundDate

The olderBoundDate (SWE::Quantity) property reports the older bounding time coordinate in an age range.

8.4.2.2.3    youngerBoundDate

The youngerBoundDate (SWE::Quantity) property reports the younger bounding time coordinate in an age range.

8.4.3    Geologic Structure

Geologic Structure is a package of classes to describe GeologicStructures which are a configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an EarthMaterial.  The scale of geological structures ranges from microscopic (micron-scale) to megascopic (km-scale). Examples of such inhomogeneities include fractures, mineral grain boundaries, and boundaries between parts of the rock with different particle geometry (texture) or composition.

GeologicStructure is grounded in relationships between parts of a rock or rock body. As used here, it includes sedimentary structures. The identity of a GeologicStructure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure although there are almost always strong dependencies between the nature of the earth material substrate and the kinds of geological structure that may be present.

A disaggregated heap of particles does not have structure, and can only be described in terms of the mineralogy and geometrical character of the constituent particles.  Geologic structures are more likely to be found in, and are more persistent in, consolidated materials than in unconsolidated materials. Properties like “clast-supported”, “matrix-supported”, and “graded bed” that do not involve orientation are considered kinds of GeologicStructure because they depend on the configuration of parts of a rock body.

8.4.3.1    GeologicStructure

A geologic structure is a configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an earth material.  The identity of a GeologicStructure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure.  The general GeologicFeatureRelation (available in the Extension package – see 8.5) is used to associate penetrative GeologicStructures with GeologicUnits.  GeoSciML Basic only provides a limited set of core structures (Contact, Fold, ShearDisplacementStructure and Foliation) with a single property to categorise them.  Supplemental properties (through the pattern described in 5.1.1) and geologic structure types are available from the Extension package.

8.4.3.2    Contact

A contact is a general concept representing any kind of surface separating two geologic units, including primary boundaries such as depositional contacts, all kinds of unconformities, intrusive contacts, and gradational contacts, as well as faults that separate geologic units.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Contact context diagram
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.3.2.1    contactType

The property contactType:ContactTypeTerm classifies the contact (e.g. intrusive, unconformity, bedding surface, lithologic boundary, phase boundary) and is a term from a controlled vocabulary.

8.4.3.2.2    stContactDescription (stub property)

The property stContactDescription:ContactAbstractDescription provides a detailed contact description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since ContactAbstractDescription is an abstract class with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.3.3    Fold

A fold is formed by one or more systematically curved layers, surfaces, or lines in a rock body. A fold denotes a structure formed by the deformation of a geologic structure, such as a contact which the original undeformed geometry is presumed, to form a structure that may be described by the translation of an abstract line (the fold axis) parallel to itself along some curvilinear path (the fold profile). Folds have a hinge zone (zone of maximum curvature along the surface) and limbs (parts of the deformed surface not in the hinge zone).  Folds are described by an axial surface, hinge line, profile geometry, the solid angle between the limbs, and the relationships between adjacent folded surfaces if the folded structure is a Layering fabric. 

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Fold context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.3.3.1    profileType

The property profileType:FoldProfileTypeTerm contains a term from a controlled vocabulary specifying the concave/convex geometry of fold relative to earth surface, and relationship to younging direction in folded strata if known. (e.g., antiform, synform, neutral, anticline, syncline, monocline, ptygmatic).

8.4.3.3.2    stFoldDescription (stub property)

The property stFoldDescription:FoldAbstractDescription provides a detailed fold description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since FoldAbstractDescription is an abstract class with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.3.4    Foliation

A foliation is a planar arrangement of textural or structural features in any type of rock.  It includes any of a wide variety of penetrative planar geological structures that may be present in a rock.  Examples include schistosity, mylonitic foliation, penetrative bedding structure (lamination), and cleavage.  Following the proposed definition of gneiss by the NADM Science Language Technical Team [12], penetrative planar foliation defined by layers > 5 mm thick is considered Layering.

Bedding is a fabric representing the average orientation of paleodepositional surface and should be encoded through the foliationType property.  It might apply to bedding that is layering or a foliation without layering (e.g. clast alignment in amalgamated beds).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Foliation context diagram
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.3.4.1    foliationType

The foliationType:FoliationTypeTerm property specifies the type of foliation from a controlled vocabulary.  Examples include crenulation cleavage, slaty cleavage and schistosity.

8.4.3.4.2    stFoliationDescription (stub property)

The property stFoliationDescription:FoliationAbstractDescription provides a detailed foliation description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since FoliationAbstractDescription is an abstract class with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.3.5    ShearDisplacementStructure

A shear displacement structure includes all brittle to ductile style structures along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single ‘planar’ brittle or ductile surface to a fault system comprised of tens of strands of both brittle and ductile nature. This structure may have some significant thickness (a deformation zone) and have an associated body of deformed rock that may be considered a deformation unit (which geologicUnitType is ‘DeformationUnit’) which can be associated to the ShearDisplacementStructure using GeologicFeatureRelation from the GeoSciML Extension package (8.5.1.2).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : ShearDisplacementStructure context diagram
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.3.5.1    faultType

The faultType:FaultTypeTerm property contains a term from a controlled vocabulary describing the type of shear displacement structure (e.g., thrust fault, normal fault or wrench fault).

8.4.3.5.2    stStructureDescription

The property stStructureDescription:ShearDisplacementStructureAbstractDescription provides a detailed geologic structure description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since ShearDisplacementStructureAbstractDescription is an abstract class with subtypes defined in GeoSciML Extension.

8.4.4    Geomorphology

The Geomorphology sub-package describes features that comprise the shape and nature of the Earth’s land surface (i.e., landforms).  These landforms may be created by natural or anthropogenic processes.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Geomorphologic feature summary diagram
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.4.1    GeomorphologicFeature

A geomorphologic feature is a kind of GeologicFeature describing the shape and nature of the Earth’s land surface.  These landforms may be created by natural Earth processes (e.g., river channel, beach, moraine or mountain) or through human (anthropogenic) activity (e.g., dredged channel, reclaimed land, mine waste dumps).  In GeoSciML, the geomorphologic feature is modelled as a feature related (through unitDescription property) to a GeologicUnit that composes the form.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Partial encoding of landform located in Elba Island as part of a geomorphological unit (encoded from a map from D’Orefice et al, 2009)
			
		
	


	
	

Figure 23 shows an example of GeoSciML encoding of a landform lava cone geomorphologic unit (from [2]) located in Elba Island showing how the geomorphologic feature is related to the geologic unit and materials that it is made of.

8.4.4.1.1    unitDescription

The unitDescription property is an association that links the geomorphologic feature to a geologic description (e.g., related stratigraphic units and earth materials).

8.4.4.1.2    gmFeatureDescription (stub property)

The property gmFeatureDescription:GeomorphologicUnitAbstractDescription provides a detailed morphologic description.  This is a stub property in GeoSciML Basic since GeomorphologicUnitAbstractDescription is an abstract class with no concrete subtype in GeoSciML Basic.

8.4.4.2    NaturalGeomorphologicFeature

A natural geomorphologic feature is a geomorphologic feature (i.e., landform) that has been created by natural Earth processes. For example, river channel, beach ridge, caldera, canyon, moraine or mud flat.

8.4.4.2.1    naturalGeomorphologicFeatureType

The property naturalGeomorphologicFeatureType: NaturalGeomorphologicFeatureTypeTerm is a reference from a controlled vocabulary describing the type of geomorphologic feature.

8.4.4.2.2    activity

The activity property (SWE::Category) contains a category term from a controlled vocabulary describing the current activity status of the geomorphologic feature (e.g., currently active, dormant, inactive, reactivated, etc.).

8.4.4.3    AnthropogenicGeomorphologicFeature

An anthropogenic geomorphologic feature is a geomorphologic feature (i.e., landform) which has been created by human activity.  For example, a dredged channel, midden, open pit or reclaimed land.

8.4.4.3.1    anthropogenicGeomorphologicFeatureType

The anthropogenicGeomorphologicFeatureType: AnthropogenicGeomorphologicFeatureTypeTerm is a reference from a controlled vocabulary describing the type of geomorphologic feature.

8.4.5    Collection

A GeoSciML collection is a convenience class to manage sets of features or type instances.  A collection contains classes that facilitate the structuring of WFS response documents and other application uses.

8.4.5.1    GSML

GSML is a collection class grouping a set of features or types which are members of this collection.  A collectionType property provides context or purpose.

8.4.5.1.1    member

The member property is an association that links a GSML instance to features and objects to be included as members of the collection.  A collection can be made of heterogeneous items.

8.4.5.1.2    collectionType

The collectionType:CollectionTypeTerm property contains a term from a controlled vocabulary describing the type of collection, such as Geologic Map, Boreholes, 3D models.

8.4.5.2    GSMLItem

GSMLItem (Figure 24) constrains the collection members to instances of EarthMaterial, GeologicFeature, GM_Object, MappedFeature, AbstractFeatureRelation and OM::SF_SamplingFeature.  GSMLItem has the stereotype <<Union>> and according to ISO19103 (Clause 6.8.2), only one of the properties can be materialized at the time. It is important to note that the <<Union>> stereotype can be encoded in two distinct ways.

a)     by materializing the GSMLItem  (as prescribed by ISO 19136)
 
 
 


b)    using GSMLItem as a validation constraint


 

This requirements class does not impose any encoding style for Union stereotype, although in the XML encoding requirements class (see 9.3) we chose the second option.

8.4.6    GeoSciML data types

GeoSciML Data is a package of data types that describes the planar or linear orientation of a geologic feature using conventions used in geology. They allow specifying direction by a numerical direction vector (e.g., dip/dip direction), or as a description (e.g., compass point (NE), or other text - “toward fold hinge”, “below”).  An additional GSML_QuantityRange class extends SWE::QuantityRange to allow upper and lower values in a numerical range to be delivered as two separate attributes. This is to facilitate query operations on upper and lower values by providing explicit names for these values (which are otherwise encoded as anonymous members of an array in SWE common).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Summary diagram of specialised GeoSciML data types
			
		
	


	
	

8.4.6.1    GSML_GeometricDescriptionValue

GSML_GeometricDescriptionValue is a special abstract data type for descriptions of planar or linear orientations of a geologic feature.   Different subtypes allow specifying direction by direction vector (e.g. dip/dip direction), compass point (e.g.  NE), or description (e.g. “toward fold hinge”, "below’).

8.4.6.1.1    determinationMethod

The determinationMethod:DeterminationMethodTerm  property describes the way the orientation value was determined (e.g. measured, inferred from dip slope, etc.) using a reference to a controlled vocabulary.

8.4.6.1.2    descriptiveOrientation

The descriptionOrientation:Primitive::CharacterString contains a textual specification of orientation, possibly referencing some local geography (e.g. “toward fold hinge”, “below”).

8.4.6.2    GSML_PlanarOrientation

A planar orientation is composed of two values; the azimuth (a compass point) and a dip (the angle from the horizontal).  Polarity of the plane indicates whether the planar orientation is associated with a directed feature that is overturned, upright, vertical, etc.  There are several conventions to encode a planar orientation and this specification does not impose one but provides a convention property to report it. It must be noted that allowance for different conventions makes manipulation of the data more difficult. Therefore it is recommended that user communities adopt a single measurement convention.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/plane-pol-dip-az-not-null
  
	
  At least one of polarity, azimuth or dip
  SHALL not be null.

  



To have any meaningful value, the planar orientation shall have at least a value for polarity, azimuth or dip.

8.4.6.2.1    convention

The property convention:ConventionCode contains the convention used for the measurement from a controlled vocabulary.

8.4.6.2.2    azimuth

The azimuth (SWE::QuantityRange) property (compass point, bearing etc.) contains the value of the orientation. The convention property (8.4.6.2.1) reports how azimuth is interpreted (if it is relative to a quadrant).

8.4.6.2.3    dip

The dip (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the angle that the structural surface (e.g. bedding, fault plane) makes with the horizontal measured perpendicular to the strike of the structure and in the vertical plane as a numeric value or term.

8.4.6.2.4    polarity

The polarity:PolarityCode indicates whether the planar orientation is associated with a directed feature that is overturned, upright, vertical etc., using a controlled vocabulary.

 

8.4.6.3    GSML_LinearOrientation

A linear orientation is composed of a trend (the compass orientation of the line) and a plunge (the angle from the horizontal).  This vector may be oriented (pointing in a specific direction) or not.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/linear-trend-plunge-not-null
  
	
  At
  least one of plunge or trend SHALL NOT be null.

   

  



To have any meaningful value, an instance of GSML_LinearOrientation shall at least have a trend or a plunge value.

8.4.6.3.1    directed

The directed:LinearDirectedCode property indicates if the orientation represents a linear feature that is directed, e.g. clast imbrication, mylonitic lineation with sense of shear, slickenlines with displacement direction, rather than undirected (like a fold hinge line or intersection lineations).  A code list will indicate which is the directed end of the linear orientation.  The value of the property comes from a controlled vocabulary.

8.4.6.3.2    plunge

The property plunge (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the magnitude of the plunge as an angle from horizontal.

8.4.6.3.3    trend

The property trend (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the azimuth (compass bearing) value of the linear orientation. 

8.4.6.4    GSML_Vector

A GSML_Vector is a data type representing a linear orientation with a magnitude (a quantity assigned to this vector).   If the magnitude is unknown, a GSML_LinearOrientation (8.4.6.3) shall be used.

8.4.6.4.1    magnitude

The magnitude property (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the magnitude of the vector.

8.4.6.5    GSML_QuantityRange

GSML_QuantityRange is a specialization of SWE Common QuantiytyRange (OGC 08-094r1, Clause 7.2.13)  where lower and upper values are made explicit.  SWE::QuantityRange uses an array of values (RealPair, see Clause OGC 08-094r1,7.2.1) where the lowest value is the first element and the highest the second.  This convenience data type has been created as an alternative encoding for implementations that do no support encoding of arrays in a single field (e.g. DBF) or reference to elements in string encoded arrays[3] (eg. Filter Encoding Specification 2.0 – OGC 09-029r2).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Context diagram for QuantityRange making lower and upper values explicit
			
		
	


	
	

The lowerValue shall be less than or equal to the upperValue.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/quantity-range-order
  
	
  The QuantityRange lowerValue SHALL be less
  than or equal to the upperValue.   

  



The values reported in lowerValue and upperValue shall be the same as the pair of values in inherited values property.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-basic/quantity-range-repeat
  
	
  The QuantityRange’s value[0] SHALL provide
  the same value as lowerValue and value[1] SHALL provide the same value as
  upperValue.

  



8.4.6.5.1    lowerValue

The property lowerValue:Real contains the lower bound of the range. It shall be a copy of inherited SWE::QuantityRange::value[0].

8.4.6.5.2    upperValue

The property upperValue:Real contains the upper bound of the range. It shall be a copy of inherited SWE::QuantityRange::value[1].

Example:

8.4.7    GeoSciML Basic vocabularies

Geology is a descriptive science and uses vocabularies extensively.  Table 4 lists the vocabularies used in GeoSciML Basic.  Each of those vocabularies shall be implemented using externally managed vocabularies as specified in clause 8.2.7

				Figure: : Summary diagram of GeologicFeatureRelation as a concrete subtype of AbstractFeatureRelation stub class
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.1.1    GeologicHistory

GeoSciML uses the generic relatedFeature:GeologicFeatureRelation to associate GeologicFeature with other GeologicFeatures, which includes GeologicEvents.  However, this functionality is only available from the Extension package because it adds extra complexity that Basic hopes to avoid. 

To allow geologic age description in GeoSciML Basic without GeologicFeatureRelation, GeologicFeature has an explicit geologicHistory property to associate GeologicFeature with a GeologicEvent.  The consequence for someone using GeoSciML Extension is the presence of two different ways to link a GeologicFeature and GeologicEvent:

	 A direct association through geologicHistory
	 A generic GeologicFeatureRelation.


To prevent confusion and promote consistency, especially in query scenarios, association between GeologicFeature and GeologicEvent, for the purpose of describing geologic history, and therefore geologic age, shall use the geologicHistory property.  A GeologicFeatureRelation can be used in any other circumstances.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-extension/geologicfeature-history
  
	
  A GeologicFeatureRelation SHALL not be used between a GeologicFeature and GeologicEvent if GeologicFeature::geologicHistory can provide the same information.

  



8.5.1.2    GeologicFeatureRelation

The GeologicFeatureRelation class defines the general structure used to define relationships between any GeoSciML feature types.  Relationships are always binary and directional.  There is always a single source and a single target.  The relationship is always defined from the perspective of the Source and is generally an active verb. 

Example:  a Source may point to an intrusive igneous rock unit.  In this case, the Target would point to the appropriate host rock body and the relationship attribute would be ‘intrudes’.  Other appropriate relationship attributes might include: overlies, offsets, crosscuts, folds, etc.

Many other types of relationships can also be accommodated via GeologicRelation, for example, topological relations could be described where they are geologically significant.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Generic geologic feature relation
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.1.2.1    relationship

The relationship:GeologicRelationshipTerm property contains a term from a controlled vocabulary to describe the geologic relationship (e.g., stratigraphic relation, structural relation, intrusive relation).

8.5.1.2.2    sourceRole

The property sourceRole:RelationRoleProperty contains a term from a controlled vocabulary describing the role played by the source geologic feature or object (e.g., overlying unit, underlying unit).

8.5.1.2.3    targetRole

The property targetRole:RelationRoleTerm contains a term from a controlled vocabulary describing the role played by the target geologic feature or object. (e.g., overlying unit, underlying unit)

8.5.1.3    MaterialRelation

The MaterialRelation class describes the relationships between constituent parts in an EarthMaterial (e.g. A mineral overgrowth on a phenocryst within a granite). 

Example:  Consider an overgrowth of albite on plagioclase in a granite. The Source would originate with the albite constituentPart description.  In this case, the Target would point to the plagioclase constituentPart description and the relationship attribute would be ‘overgrowth’ and the sourceRole is ‘overgrows’.  Other appropriate role attributes might include: crosscuts, replaces, etc. for crosscutting and replacement relationships.  Inverse relationships must be explicitly recorded.

8.5.1.3.3    targetRole

The property targetRole:RelationRoleTerm contains a term describing the role played by the target earth material part (e.g., matrix, clast, overgrowth).

8.5.2    EarthMaterialDetails

EarthMaterialDescription abstract class is materialised into a series of concrete classes to address various aspects of EarthMaterial descriptions:

	CompositionDescription
	FabricDescription
	RockMaterialDescription
	AlterationDescription
	PhysicalDescription
	MetamorphicDescription
	CompoundMaterialDescription

8.5.2.1    AlterationDescription

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Alteration description context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

AlterationDescription describes aspects of a geologic unit or earth material that are the result of bulk chemical, mineralogical or physical changes related to change in the physical or chemical environment. It includes weathering, supergene alteration, hydrothermal alteration and metasomatic effects not considered metamorphic. For example, a soil profile description would have to be constructed as a GeologicUnit (geologicUnitType = PedologicUnit) with unit parts representing the various horizons in the profile.  Thickness of a weathering profile can be delivered as unitThickness of a GeologicUnit of geologicUnitType equal to “AlterationUnit” (Figure 38).

An example encoding of an altered geologic unit from Drewes [3] is shown in Figure 39.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Example of describing alteration halo from Drewes [3].
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.2.1.1    alterationType

The property alterationType:AlterationTypeTerm contains a term from a controlled vocabulary of alteration types (e.g., potassic, argillic, advanced argillic).

8.5.2.1.2    alterationProduct

The property alterationProduct is an association between the AlterationDescripton and EarthMaterial describing the material resulting from the alteration processes, e.g. alteration minerals, saprolite, ferricrete, clay, calcrete, skarn, etc. Materials observed in a soil profile could be identified using this property.

8.5.2.1.3    alterationDistribution

The alterationDistribution (SWE::Category) property describes the spatial distribution or geometry of alteration zones using a term from a controlled vocabulary. e.g., patchy, spotted, banded, veins, vein breccia, pervasive, disseminated, etc.

8.5.2.1.4    alterationDegree

The property alterationDegree (SWE::Category) contains a term from a controlled vocabulary to indicate the magnitude of observed alteration.

8.5.2.1.5    alterationEvent

The property alterationEvent is an association between an AlterationDescription and a GeologicEvent describing the GeologicEvent associated with the alteration.

8.5.2.2    ChemicalComposition

ChemicalComposition is a kind of EarthMaterialDescription that delivers the chemical composition of a geological unit or earth material, as a list of element or oxide concentrations.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Chemical composition context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.2.2.1    chemicalAnalysis

The chemicalAnalysis property (SWE:DataRecord) contains a collection of geochemical results in a form of a DataRecord (a collection of fields composed of description and values).

8.5.2.3    CompoundMaterialDescription

The CompoundMaterialDescription class is a kind of EarthMaterialDescription that provides an extended description of a compound earth material (i.e., rocks and unconsolidated solid earth materials).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Compound material description context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.2.3.1    compositionCategory

The compositionCategory property (SWE::Category) provides a term from a controlled vocabulary to specify the gross compositional character of a compound material. Composition as used here is loosely construed to include both chemical composition and petrographic composition, thus multiple values may be applied to a single rock, e.g. metaluminous and alkalic, undersaturated and basic, etc. Terms would typically include broad chemical classifications such as silicate, carbonate, ferromagnesian, oxide.  However, this attribute may have different terminology for different kinds of rocks - for example sandstone petrographic classification terms (e.g. feldspathic) might be placed here.

8.5.2.3.2    geneticCategory

The property geneticCategory (SWE::Category) provides a term from a controlled vocabulary that represents a summary geologic history of the material. (i.e., a genetic process classifier term). Examples include igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, shock metamorphic, volcanic, pyroclastic.

8.5.2.3.3    particleGeometry

The particleGeometry:ParticleGeometryDescription contains an instance of ParticleGeometryDescription.

8.5.2.3.4    constituent

The property constituent is an association between a CompoundMaterialDescription and a ConstituentPart that makes up part of the CompoundMaterial.

8.5.2.4    ParticleGeometryDescription

ParticleGeometryDescription describes particles in a CompoundMaterial independent of their relationship to each other or their orientation. It is distinguished from Fabric in that the ParticleGeometryDescription remains constant if the material is disaggregated into its constituent particles, whereas Fabric is lost if the material is disaggregated.  Properties include the particle size (grainsize), particle sorting (size distribution, e.g., well sorted, poorly sorted, bimodal sorting), particle shape (surface rounding or crystal face development, e.g., well rounded, euhedral, anhedral), and particle aspect ratio (e.g., elongated, platy, bladed, compact, acicular).

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : ParticleGeometry context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.5.2.4.1    particleType

The particleType:ParticleTypeTerm provides a term from a controlled vocabulary to specify the nature of individual particles of each constituent in an EarthMaterial aggregation, based mostly on their genesis.  When applied on ParticleDescription for CompoundMaterial, it would characterise all particles in aggregate. Use this property on CompoundMaterial to distinguish rocks composed of crystals (crystalline rocks) from rocks composed of granular particles (clasts, fragments). Examples include ooliths, crystals, pore space. Constituent type is determined based on the nature of the particles, and ideally is independent of the relationship between particles in a compound material aggregation.

8.5.2.4.2    aspectRatio

The aspectRatio property (SWE::Category) contains a term from a controlled vocabulary describing the geometry of particles based on the ratios of lengths of long, intermediate and short axes of grains. It equates to sphericity in sedimentary rocks (i.e., the degree to which the shape of a particle approximates a sphere).  The formal definition is “A quantitative specification based on the ratio of lengths of long, intermediate and short axes of grain shape” [16] [24]. (e.g., prolate, slightly flattened, very bladed, equant, acicular, tabular).

8.5.2.4.3    shape

The shape property (SWE::Category) describes,

	 the development of crystal faces bounding particles in crystalline compound materials, and
	 the surface rounding of grains in sedimentary rocks. Roundness is a measure of the sharpness of the edges between surfaces bounding a particle [10] [22].


The terms shall be a term from a controlled vocabulary and be appropriate for the kind of compound material (e.g., for crystalline rocks- euhedral, ideoblastic, subhedral, anhedral, xenoblastic; for sedimentary rocks - angular, rounded).

8.5.2.4.4    size

The property size (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the size that specifies particle grainsize.  Values may be reported using absolute measurements (e.g., range, mean, median, mode, maximum).

8.5.2.4.5    sorting

The sorting property (SWE::Category) contains a term from a vocabulary that specifies the size distribution of particles in a CompoundMaterial. Terminology for sorting in sedimentary rocks is based on the quantitative Graphic Standard Deviation (IGSD) scheme proposed by Folk [5] [6].  Example for this attribute may include sedimentary terms such as well sorted and poorly sorted, or igneous terms such as porphyritic, equigranular, seriate.

8.5.2.5    ConstituentPart

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : ConstituentPart context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

The ConstituentPart class describes how Earth materials may be made up of other Earth materials, including the proportion of the constituent part in the whole (e.g., 20%, minor, dominant); and the role that the constituent plays in the whole (e.g., matrix, groundmass, framework, phenocryst, xenolith, vein).

The distinction between "role" and "particleType" is subtle.  An operational test is that particleType may be determined independent of relationship between particles in the aggregation, whereas role requires consideration of the relationship to other particles. A particle may be identified as a clast, independent of its material composition, and independent of its relationship to other grains in a rock. The term ‘floating clast’ is a role, because it is dependent on the relationship ‘not in contact with other clasts’. Readers should consider Dunham’s textural classification of carbonate rocks (wackestone, packstone, grainstone, etc.) in the description of carbonate rocks [4]. The description is predicated on identification of two kinds of intraclasts (grains) and matrix (carbonate mud), and then uses this distinction to establish relationships–mud supported vs. grain supported – that define roles for the two types of constituents (framework, matrix…).

8.5.2.5.1    role

The role:ConstituentPartRoleTerm property contains a term from a controlled vocabulary that describes the role a ConstituentPart plays in a CompoundMaterial aggregation. The same EarthMaterial may occur as different ConstituentParts playing different roles within one CompoundMaterial.  For example, feldspar may be present as groundmass (“groundmass” is a ConstituentPart::role) and as phenocrysts (“phenocryst” is another ConstituentPart::role) within a single igneous rock.

8.5.2.5.2    proportion

The proportion property (SWE::QuantityRange) reports the fraction of the whole that is formed by a ConstituentPart in a part/whole relationship.  It is used for the ConstituentPart portion in a CompoundMaterial.  It specifies the fraction of the EarthMaterial formed by the part (e.g., 20%, minor, dominant).

8.5.2.5.3    constituentMaterial

The constituentMaterial property is an association between a ConstituentPart and an EarthMaterial that specifies the EarthMaterial that is forming the ConstituentPart.

8.5.2.6    FabricDescription

The FabricDescription data type describes all types of fabrics associated with a CompoundMaterial (i.e., tectonic, metamorphic, sedimentary, igneous fabrics or textures).  It denotes a pattern, defined by one or more CompoundMaterial constituents, that is present throughout a rock body when considered at some scale.  FabricDescription is defined based on the average configuration of many constituents.  Penetrative fabric denotes that these constituents are distributed throughout the rock volume at the scale of observation [15], and are repeated at distances that are small relative to the scale of the whole, such that they can be considered to pervade the whole uniformly ([19] p. 21-24; [7] p. 73; [10],[15]).

FabricDescription is distinguished from ParticleGeometry based on the criteria that particle geometry is preserved if a CompoundMaterial is disaggregated, while FabricDescription is not defined if the material is disaggregated.

It is defined based on the average configuration of many constituents. Penetrative fabric denotes that these constituents are distributed throughout the rock volume at the scale of observation [15], and are repeated at distances that are small relative to the scale of the whole, such that they can be considered to pervade the whole uniformly.

(e.g., density, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, remanent magnetism).  These properties are modelled here as scalar numeric values (SWE::Quantity).

Vector and tensor physical properties are considered to be more applicable to located observations and should be delivered as OM_Observations with associated geologic unit or geologic structure features.  Since PhysicalProperty can be an arbitrary property, it satisfies the requirements of clause 7.2.2.8 or OGC 10-004r3 that states that “The observed property shall be a phenomenon associated with the feature-of-interest.”, and hence any GeologicUnit, GeologicStructure are valid features of interest for any OM_Observation.

8.6.2.1    TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem

TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem is a time reference system comprised of an ordered set of time periods (time ordinal eras).

8.6.2.1.1    referencePoint

The property referencePoint is an association between a TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem and a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary.  A TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem refers to two reference points defining the extent of the system.

8.6.2.1.2    component

The property component is an association to a TimeOrdinalEra that is part of the TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem.  A TimeOrdinalReferenceSystem is composed of a collection of TimeOrdinalEras.

8.6.2.2    TimeOrdinalEra

TimeOrdinalEra is a period of time between two time boundaries.  The association of an era with a stratotype is optional.  In the GSSP approach recommended by ICS for the Global Geologic Timescale, Unit Stratotypes are not used.  Rather, the association of an era with geologic units and sections is indirect, via the association of an era with boundaries, which are in turn tied to stratotype points, which occur within host stratotype sections.  TimeOrdinalEra can be composed of other eras and organized into an arbitrarily nested tree.

8.6.2.2.1    member

The property member is an association between a TimeOrdinalEra and another TimeOrdinalEra which is hierarchically below.  The referred TimeOrdinalEras are subdivision the current TimeOrdinalEra. Note that nesting shall not be cyclic.  A TimeOrdinalEra can’t be a member of itself or any intermediate member (we can consider that member is a transitive property). This is not a model issue but a data coherence issue.

8.6.2.2.2    group

The group property is an association to a (single) parent TimeOrdinalEra. The group associations shall not produce a cyclic graph.  A TimeOrdinalEra group shall point to its immediate parent TimeOrdinalEra.   

By convention, the “start” of the TimeOrdinalEra is the oldest boundary because it is when the era “started” to exist in time.  The “end” is therefore the youngest boundary.

8.6.2.2.3    start

The start property is an association to a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary that defines the start (the oldest) boundary of the era.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-timescale/start
  
	
  The
  start TimeOrdinalEraBoundary SHALL refer to the oldest boundary

  



8.6.2.2.4    end

The end property is an association to a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary that defines the end (the youngest) boundary of the era.

8.6.2.3    TimeOrdinalEraBoundary

A TimeOrdinalEraBoundary is a point in Earth’s history which bounds a TimeOrdinalEra.

8.6.2.3.1    position

The position:TM_Instant property describes a point in time corresponding to the era boundary.

8.6.2.3.2    positionalUncertainty

The property positionalUncertainty (SWE::Quantity) contains a measure of the uncertainty in the estimate of the point in time of the era boundary.

8.6.2.3.3    previousEra

The property previousEra is an association between a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary and a TimeOrdinalEra to reference the preceding (oldest) era.

8.6.2.3.4    nextEra

The property nextEra is an association between a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary and a TimeOrdinalEra to reference the succeeding era.

8.6.2.3.5    observationalBasis

The property observationalBasis is be an association between a TimeOrdinalEraBoundary and an OM::OM_Observation in support of the existence of the boundary defined by geochronology, paleontology, or other evidence.

8.6.3    Timescale

The Timescale package describes geologic time periods (geochronologic eras) and the boundaries between them.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Time scale summary diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.6.3.1    GeologicTimeScale

The classic “Geologic Timescale” (http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale) comprising an ordered, hierarchical set of named “eras” is an example of an Ordinal Temporal Reference System. It may be calibrated with reference to a numeric Temporal Coordinate System, but is, in principle, defined independently.

8.6.3.2    GeochronologicEra

A GeochronologicEra is a period of time between two GeochronologicBoundaries. The association of a GeochronologicEra with a stratotype is optional.  In the GSSP approach recommended by ICS for the Global Geologic Timescale, Unit Stratotypes are not used.  Rather, the association of an era with geologic units and sections is indirect, via the association of an era with boundaries, which are in turn tied to stratotype points, which occur within host stratotype sections.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : GeochronologicEra context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.6.3.2.1    rank

The property rank:GeochronologicEraRank contains a term from a vocabulary describing the rank of the time period (e.g., eon, era, period, stage).

8.6.3.2.2    stratotype

The property stratotype is an association between a GeochronologicEra and StratigraphicSection that describes a type section that names the physical location or outcrop of a particular reference exposure of a stratigraphic sequence or stratigraphic boundary. A unit stratotype is the agreed reference point for a particular stratigraphic unit and a boundary stratotype is the reference for a particular boundary between strata (Wikipedia).

8.6.3.3    GeochronologicBoundary

A GeochronologicBoundary is a boundary between two geochronologic time periods.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : GeochronologicBoundary context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.6.3.3.1    stratotype

The property stratotype is an association between a GeochronologicBoundary and a StratigraphicPoint that are associated with the boundary. A GeochronologicBoundary can be associated with more than one StratigraphicPoints, but only one may have GSSP ratified status. The others are proposed equivalents.

Example:

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Partial encoding of Miocene instance diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.6.3.4    NumericEraBoundary

NumericEraBoundary is used for pre-Ediacaran and Pleistocene / Holocene boundaries in the standard timescale where boundaries are not defined by a material reference but as numerical values.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : NumericEraBoundary context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.6.3.5    StandardGlobalNumericalAge

A standard numeric age point (a numeric analogue to a ‘golden spike’) is applicable to the formal subdivision of the Precambrian, and perhaps the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary ([23]; http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale).  The boundary is not defined from a physical stratotype, although it can be influence by some, but placed at a convenient numerical value.

8.6.4    GeoSciML GeologicTime vocabularies

The GeologicTime package has only one vocabulary (Table 6).

8.7.1    Borehole

This requirements class describes Borehole and BoreholeInterval and related data types.  This package describes a borehole as a means to sample geologic units underground and thus provide a linear map of the geology.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Borehole context diagram.
			
		
	


	
	

8.7.1.1    Borehole

A Borehole is the generalized term for any narrow shaft drilled in the ground, either vertically, horizontally, or inclined.

The property downholeDrillingDetails:DrillingDetails specifies the drilling method and borehole diameter for intervals down the borehole.

8.7.1.1.3    logElement

The property logElement is an association between a Borehole and a BoreholeInterval instance to describe measured downhole intervals and their observed features.

8.7.1.1.4    referenceLocation

The property referenceLocation is an association between a Borehole and an OriginPosition corresponding to the start point of a borehole log.  This may correspond to the borehole collar location (e.g., kelly bush).

8.7.1.1.5    OM:sampledFeature

Borehole inherits sampledFeature from OM::SF_SamplingFeature, which links the sampling feature to the real world feature it is designed to sample (19156:2011, clause 9.2.2.4). In the context of GeoSciML, this will typically be a GeologicFeature, such as a geologic unit. Where a SamplingFeature samples multiple features (e.g. borehole, traverse)

	 if it is a sequence of units, then the part:GeologicUnitPart mechanisms may be used,
	 else if it is an informal collection that exists only because of the sampling, then multiple sampledFeature roles should be used


8.7.1.2    DrillingDetails

DrillingDetails is a class that captures the description of drilling methods and hole diameters down the drilling path.  Properties that apply to the Borehole as a whole are managed in BoreholeDetails (8.7.1.4).

	
		
		

			
				Figure : Drilling details

  Requirement /req/gsml4-borehole/borehole-position-null
  
	
  If
  no GM_Point is available, an OGC nil value SHALL

GeoSciML Lite is a simplification of parts of GeoSciML and Observations and Measurements (ISO 19156) for map-based applications.  It was developed to provide a simple schema to deliver geologic map unit, contact, borehole, located sample, geomorphologic unit and shear displacement structure (fault and ductile shear zone) descriptions in web map services. The intention is to support interoperable map services, for which interoperability is based on a shared data schema and the use of standard vocabulary terms for basic type classification of contacts and faults, age of geologic units and faults, and lithology of geologic units.

Use of standard vocabularies enables map display using a shared legend (symbolization scheme) to achieve visual harmonization of maps provided by different services. In addition, the GeoSciML Lite data structure includes text fields with information for human users browsing a geologic map, a link to a full GeoSciML feature element if available, and a symbol identifier field to enable a user-defined symbolization scheme in each map service.

By linking the simple feature WMS with a GeoSciML WFS, clients can acquire geologic feature descriptions that can be used in web-mapping applications to construct custom legends. Linking to full GeoSciML features allows the Lite schema to be used in a map browsing and query interface to identify and select features for further processing that can be acquired as highly structured, information-rich GML features.

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Package dependency for GeoSciML Lite.
			
		
	


	
GeoSciML Lite conforms to the Level 0 of the Simple Features Profile for GML (OGC 10-100r, OGC 06-049). The simple features profile supports only a limited subset of possible GML geometry types that may be used to describe feature geographic location and shape. For the purposes of GeoSciML simple features, these include GEO::Point, GEO::LineString, GEO::Curve, GEO::Polygon, GEO::Surface, GEO::MultiPoint, GEO::MultiCurve, GEO::MultiSurface and multi-geometry types consisting of collections of these base types.

GeoSciML Lite features are analogous to GeoSciML MappedFeatures and O&M sampling features, with additional text attributes for human consumption, a flatted-relation view of the age, and assignment to a single lithology. The Lite schema consists of ‘free-text’ fields and identifier fields.  Best practice is that free text fields will, where possible, contain well-structured summaries of data in a format suitable for reading by the intended users.  For instance, an agreed common format like comma-delimited values should be adopted by user communities. Identifier fields should contain identifiers for concepts from a controlled vocabulary (for example CGI Simple Lithology (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/)) that specify representative thematic properties for a feature. Inclusion of these standardized identifiers enables interoperability across services. Ideally the identifiers should be URIs that can be resolved to obtain machine-processable or human-readable representations of the identified concepts.

In addition, some features include an (optional) identifier for a specification (specification_uri), which is a resource containing a description of that particular feature. In many cases, these descriptions will be the same for all geometries assigned to the same map unit or classified as the same kind of contact or structure. If more complete information is available, different specification descriptions may be associated within subsets of mapped features of the same type that are portrayed with the same symbol. In the most extreme case, each mapped feature occurrence might have a unique description that captures the full spatial variability of a geologic unit or structure. Following the standard patterns of web architecture, the specification_uri should be resolvable to obtain one or more representations of that description. For maximum interoperability, one of these representations should be a GeoSciML encoded description of the feature, but other encodings might also be available, for example HTML web pages, other XML schema, or JSON. For those familiar with the GeoSciML Basic package, the specification_uri property is equivalent to the specification association from MappedFeature to GeologicFeature.

8.9.1    Property mapping

Lite properties are mapped to existing GeoSciML or O&M properties.  Values from GeoSciML and O&M complex properties are converted into GML SF-0 valid basic types (OGC 10-100r2, Clause 8.4.4.1). Different transformations scenarios are possible:


 
		 The GeoSciML property is already a basic type and the value is used as-is
	 A representative element of the complex type is used. For example; only SWE::Category::value.
	 The value is constructed from several fields merged into a single string.


Lite properties cardinalities are limited to 0..1, while GeoSciML properties are often multiple.  The data provider must then either a) choose one representative value or b) aggregate from the collection of values a new value.  Strings will generally be concatenated while numerical values might be averaged or processed in some way to produce a significant value.  Some Lite properties are designed to represent explicitly one particular occurrence, such as GeologicUnitView::representativeOlderAge_uri, which is the oldest age.  Others are more suggestive and require the judgement of the data provider, such as GeologicUnitView::representativeLithology_uri.  When values are concatenated, they shall be human readable and using simple separators (e.g., commas).

Properties ending with “_uri” shall not have concatenated values.  Those properties are designed to fulfill specific query and rendering use cases.

For each GeoSciML Lite view, a table provides the mapping between Lite and GeoSciML properties.  The mapping is expressed in OCL syntax as a path from the base type of the view to the property where the value resides in GeoSciML.

For example:

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : Mapping of key GeologicUnitView properties to GeoSciML
			
		
	


	
	

Figure 98 shows mapping for some GeologicUnitView properties.  Number 3 on this figure maps GeologicUnitView::lithology to RockMaterial, which requires a traverse from the base type (MappedFeature) to GeologicUnit, CompositionPart and then RockMaterial.

 

In OCL,




specification:GeomorphologicUnit::unitDescription[1]:GeologicUnit::compos
ition[1]:CompositionPart::material:RockMaterial::lithology



The base type (MappedFeature) is not included as it is the context type.  Package names are not shown to keep the path readable.

 

A W3C XPath equivalent (using prefixes proposed in 9.1)

 




gsmlb:Specification/gsmlb:GeomorphologicUnit/gsmlb:unitDescription[1]/gsm
lb:GeologicUnit/gsmlb:composition[1]/gsmlb:CompositionPart/gsmlb:material
/gsmlb:RockMaterial/gsmlb:lithology



An exact path is provided when possible (e.g., see 8.9.3.1), for instance to a property of compatible types.  But there are cases where the type cannot be expressed directly in OCL.


 
		 Part of the model, such as classifiers with <<CodeList>> don’t have specific model.  XML implement them as external references (xlink:href), other encoding might implement them otherwise. 
	 Any property modelled as part as metadata (MD_Metadata) as there are no explicit requirements on how GML metaDataProperty should be implemented.
	 Some values will either come from one “representative” instance, or be an aggregation.
	 Some values are not present in GeoSciML


In such cases, guidance will be provided.

8.9.2    GeoSciML Lite views

8.9.2.1    Geometry type

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/geomtype
  
	
  A dataset SHALL use a
  single geometry type (Point, Line, Polygon, etc.).  

  



A dataset (for example, a GML document or a GeoJSON instance or an ESRI shapefile) SHALL use a single geometry type. Most GIS applications and software which render a dataset containing geometry do not expect mixed geometries.

8.9.2.2    String properties

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/string
  
	
  Properties of type
  “CharacterString” SHALL contain human readable text.

  



String properties SHALL provide information easily readable by human.  The intent of string field is to display, not to query. The string properties can be translated according to the language of the user as needed while URI properties should not.

8.9.2.3    Formal Syntax

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/formal-syntax
  
	
  Syntax of text in
  character string properties SHOULD be formalised.

  



Some string properties can be constructed using formal syntax, such as comma delimited list or any other text based structure (JSON for example).  Where possible, this syntax SHOULD be formalised in a profile of this specification.

8.9.2.4    Date and Time formatting

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/datetime
  
	
  Calendar
  date and time SHALL be formatted according to ISO 8601.

  



All dates and times, excluding geological ages, shall be formatted using ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).  When a time must be specified, time zone shall be provided.

Examples:

	2016-01-05 (simple date)
	2016-01-05T08:40:15-05 (time expressed for time zone GMT -5)
	2016-01-05T13:40:15Z (same as above, but expressed in UTC a.k.a Zulu)


8.9.2.5    URI

Properties which names end with “_uri” shall contain a single absolute URI conformant to RFC 3986.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/uri
  
	
  Properties
  which name end with “_uri” SHALL contain a string conformant to URI format as
  specified in RFC 3986. 

  



Properties containing a URI should, unless stated otherwise, resolve following Linked Open Data principles.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/resolvable-uri
  
	
  Properties
  containing a valid URI SHOULD be dereferenceable.

  



Although many vocabulary terms are defined as URI, not all URIs are actually supported by a formal Linked Open Data infrastructure.   URIs are just a convenient mechanism to build unique vocabulary identifiers.  Note that in some situations, some “_uri” properties might require that the URI SHALL resolve to some valid content.  Those cases will be explicitly stated. Some community might create a profile of this requirements class and add more constraints, such as mandatory resolution of the URI to one or more resources and impose mandatory mime-types (GeoSciML/XML or GeoSciML/GeoJSON).

8.9.2.6    User defined properties

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4-lite/user-defined
  
	
  Features
  delivered with user defined properties SHALL be conformant to GML Simple
  Feature Level 0.

9.    XML Encoding Requirement classes (Normative)

XSD schemas were derived from the UML model following GML 3.3 encoding (OGC ISO19136-2, OGC 10-129r1) that extends and supersedes some of ISO 19136-2007, specifically clauses 11 (CodeType encoding) and 12.3 (Association encoding)

	
		
		

			
				Figure: : XML Encoding requirements classes dependencies (external dependencies not show)
			
		
	


	
	

The normative artefacts for XML encoding are the W3C XSD documents and W3C schematron SCH documents provided online with this specification.  Those documents explicitly provide the requirements that must be met by any XML instance claiming compliance to this specification.  Any requirements that cannot be expressed in XSD or SCH are described in the relevant XML encoding section of this document.  Therefore, compliant XML instances shall

	  validate with XSD schemas,
	  pass schematron rules and then
	  pass compliance tests listed in relevant compliance sections.

  The value of each time element SHALL include a time
  zone definition using a signed 4 digit character or a ‘Z’ to represent Zulu
  or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This is defined by the following regular
  expression: 

  (Z|[+-]HH:MM)..

  



This requirements class is shared by all GML/XML GeoSciML instances.

9.2.1    XML document validation

An XML instance shall validate to both the XSD and schematron rules provided by this specification for each of the XML requirements classes.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/xsd
  
	
  An XML
  instance SHALL validate against XSD schema.

  



 

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/sch
  
	
  An XML
  instance SHALL pass schematron rules.

  



9.2.2    CodeList

Open code lists (see 8.2.7) are encoded as gml:ReferenceType which is a sequence of gml:OwnershipAttributeGroup and gml:AssociationAttributeGroup, providing a series of xml attributes from W3C XLINK (http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/).  A vocabulary term reference has mandatory xlink:href and xlink:title attributes.




<gsmlb:lithology link:href=“http://resource.geosciml.org/ classifier/cgi/lithology/granite” xlink:title=“granite”/>




The xlink:href contains an absolute HTTP URI that should resolve to a resource representation (often a SKOS document).  The resource can have multiple representations and it is not guaranteed that an XML parsable document can be obtained from the vocabulary service.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/codelist
  
	
  Vocabulary
  term SHALL be encoded with HTTP URI in xlink:href and provide a human
  readable description in xlink:title.

  



9.2.3    Identifiers

The GeoSciML community has developed a best practice of using http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616 as a codespace for string with authority to designate string that are resolvable HTTP URI.

gml:identifier’s flagged with the specific codeSpace “http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616” should be resolvable HTTP URI that return an instance of itself.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/identifier-uri
  
	
  Feature
  identifiers (unique name) provided in gml:identifier
  and @codeSpace = “http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616” SHOULD be URI of resource using Linked Open Data
  principles.

  






<gml:identifier 
    codeSpace="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616/">
       http://data.geoscience.gov.xx/feature/asc/geologicunit/stratno/25947</gml:identifier>



Resolving http://data.geoscience.gov.xx/feature/asc/geologicunit/stratno/25947 shall return:



<gsmlb:GeologicUnit gml:id=“G1”>
(…)
<gml:identifier codeSpace="  
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616/">
       http://data.geoscience.gov.xx/feature/asc/geologicunit/stratno/25947</gml:identifier>
(…)
</gsmlb:GeologicUnit>




9.2.4    Nillables or Voidables

A nillable property (identified as “voidable” in the UML model) is a property than can document the reason that a value is not provided.  There are two ways to identify a nil value.

	Using XSD xsi:nil=”true” and nilReason.  Where available, this encoding method should be used to indicate nilled property values.
	Using a HTTP URI identifier defined by a community as representing a null value.  OGC uses http://www.opengis.net/def/nil/OGC/0/{nilReason} (OGC 12-110).


9.2.5    Date encoding

The date-time values shall conform to ISO 8601 standards.  Although this is already a GML 3.2 encoding rule (clause 14.2.2.7), this format should also be used in any string that should contain a date, or date and time.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/iso8601-time
  
	
  All
  date-time occurrences SHOULD be encoded using ISO8601 extended time format.

  



Note that this precludes the use of time-coordinate systems such as UNIX time. This is specified in order to be maximally consistent with TimeSeriesML requirements.

The time zone shall be included in the time element.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd/time-zone
  
	
  The value of each time
  element SHALL include a time zone definition using a signed 4 digit character
  or a ‘Z’ to represent Zulu or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This is defined by
  the following regular expression: 

  (Z|[+-]HH:MM).

  



Greenwich Mean Time (GMT or Zulu)



<om:phenomenonTime>
  <gml:TimeInstant gml:id="ti.1">
         <gml:timePosition>1981-09-12T00:00:00Z</gml:timePosition>
  </gml:TimeInstant>
</om:phenomenonTime>



 

Time Zone (example is Newfoundland time zone -3:30)



<om:phenomenonTime>
  <gml:TimeInstant gml:id="ti.2">
         <gml:timePosition>1981-09-12T00:00:00-03:30</gml:timePosition>

The abstract GeoSciML Lite encoding sets general encoding rules for XML targets, regardless of version of GML.

9.8.1    Simple Feature

GeoSciML Lite schemas are meant to deliver simple content, consistent with simple scenarios described in GML Simple Feature Level 0 (OGC 10-100r3).  User defined properties must respect the same constrains as defined in SF-0 specification.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd-lite/SF-0
  
	
  An XML
  instance document SHALL be compliant to GML Simple Feature Level 0.

  

 

 

Simple Feature defines 3 compliance levels summarized in Table17.

Table : Reproduction of Table 1 of 10-100r3 (Clause 2.1).

  	string, integer, measurement, date, real, binary, boolean, URI
	Point, Curve (LineString), Surface
       (Polygon), Geometry, MultiPoint, MultiCurve, MultiSurface, MultiGeometry
	In levels 0
       and 1, remote values for properties are supported only through
       the use of the type gml:ReferenceType. The more generalized GML
       property-type pattern allowing mixed inline and byReference encoded
       property values within the same instance document is disallowed.


  



9.8.2    Simple Content

SF-0 allows the definition of complex content (Clause 9.3.2 of OGC 10-100r3). To be consistent with the most common scenario encountered in GIS which is a direct mapping from a database table to XML, this specification recommends that user defined content be restricted to simple type.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd-lite/SF-0-simpletype
  
	
  User
  defined elements SHOULD be XSD simpleType.

  



GeoSciML Lite allows user defined properties to be appended at the end of the list of feature properties using xsd:any



<any processContents="lax" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
      <annotation>
            <documentation>A placeholder allowing any user-defined 
                attributes to be delivered in addition to those specified above.</documentation>
      </annotation>
</any>



Process content is set to “lax”, which means the validator will attempt to validate user defined property only if a schema is.  To help client applications and developers to validate instance containing user defined properties, a XSD schema should be provided in the instance’s schemaLocation attribute.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd-lite/user-xsd
  
	
  An
  XSD schema SHOULD be provided by data provider to validate user defined
  properties. 

  



9.8.3    User Defined Namespaces

This specification does not prescribe if the user types are to be defined in GeoSciML Lite namespace or using a different namespace.  It is understood that this might be constrained by the technology used to generate the instance.  But to avoid potential conflict with future minor changes to GeoSciML Lite, or name conflicts when aggregating results from many sources, it is recommended that the data providers, or the community, use different namespaces, if possible.

	
  Requirement /req/gsml4xsd-lite/user-ns
  
	
  User
  properties SHOULD be defined in a namespace unique to a community or a data
  provider.

[3] SWE RealPair is encoded as space delimited lists (<swe:value>10 300</swe:value> in XML) , which demands that clients parse the string to extract each token.  To build a WFS/FES query that tests the first element, it requires parsing the string either using string-before(swe:value,’ ’)  or tokenize(swe:value,’ ’).  This is cumbersome at best, or not even supported by the server at worst.  09-026r2 Clause 7.4.4 describes the minimal XPath supports and string parsing is not present.
