Abstract



The Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML encoding for the transport
and storage of geographic information, including both the spatial and
non-spatial properties of geographic features. This specification defines the
XML Schema syntax, mechanisms, and conventions that


		Provide an open, vendor-neutral framework for the definition of
    geospatial application schemas and objects;

		Allow profiles that support proper subsets of GML framework descriptive
    capabilities;

		Support the description of geospatial application schemas for
    specialized domains and information communities;

		Enable the creation and maintenance of linked geographic application
    schemas and datasets;

		Support the storage and transport of application schemas and data
  sets;

		Increase the ability of organizations to share geographic application
    schemas and the information they describe.





Implementers may decide to store geographic application schemas and
information in GML, or they may decide to convert from some other storage
format on demand and use GML only for schema and data transport.



Document status



This document is an OpenGIS® Recommendation Paper; while it constitutes a
public statement of the official view of the OGC, it does not have the status
of a Technology Specification. It is anticipated that the positions expressed
in this document will evolve in concert with the underlying XML technologies.
Although changes to this document are governed by a comprehensive review
procedure, it is expected that some of these changes may be significant.
Version 2.1 updates the GML 2.0 schemas to conform with the current W3C
Recommendation for XML Schema (dated 2001-05-02).



XML instances which are compliant to this specification shall validate
against a conforming application schema. A conforming application schema
shall import the Geometry Schema (geometry.xsd), the Feature Schema
(feature.xsd), and the XLinks schema (xlinks.xsd) as base schemas;
furthermore, it shall be developed using the rules for the development of
application schemas specified in section 5 of this document.



Sections 1 and 2 of this document present the background information and
modeling concepts that are needed to understand GML. Section 3 presents the
GML conceptual model which is independent of encoding. Section 4 presents
material which discusses the encoding of the GML conceptual model using the
XML Schema definition language (XSDL). This material is intended to
demonstrate how to employ the normative GML geometry and feature schemas
specified in Appendices A and B of this document. Section 5 of this document
presents the rules for the development of conformant GML application schemas.
Section 6 presents examples to illustrate techniques for constructing
compliant GML application to model recurring geographic themes; these
techniques are not normative but they do represent the collective experience
of the editors of this document and are strongly recommended. Conforming
profiles of this document shall be developed according the the rules
specified in section 7. Appendix A presents the Geometry schema, Appendix B
presents the Feature schema, and Appendix C presents the XLinks schema.



The OpenGIS Consortium (OGC) invites comments on this Recommendation
Paper--please submit them to gml.sig@opengis.org.

1 Representing geographic features







 

1.1   Introduction



This section introduces the key concepts required to understand how the
Geography Markup Language (GML) models the world. It is based on the OGC
Abstract Specification (available online: http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs.htm),
which defines a geographic feature as "an abstraction of a real world
phenomenon; it is a geographic feature if it is associated with a location
relative to the Earth." Thus a digital representation of the real world can
be thought of as a set of features. The state of a feature is defined by a
set of properties, where each property can be thought of as a {name, type,
value} triple. The number of properties a feature may have, together with
their names and types, are determined by its type definition. Geographic
features are those with properties that may be geometry-valued. A feature
collection is a collection of features that can itself be regarded as a
feature; as a consequence a feature collection has a feature type and thus
may have distinct properties of its own, in addition to the features it
contains.



This specification is concerned with what the OGC calls simple
features: features whose geometric properties are restricted to 'simple'
geometries for which coordinates are defined in two dimensions and the
delineation of a curve is subject to linear interpolation. While this release
of GML does permit coordinates to be specified in three dimensions, it
currently provides no direct support for three-dimensional geometry
constructs. The term 'simple features' was originally coined to describe the
functionality defined in the set of OpenGIS® Implementation Specifications
(available online: http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs.htm);
GML follows the geometry model defined in these specifications. For example,
the traditional 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometries defined in a
two-dimensional spatial reference system (SRS) are represented by points,
line strings and polygons. In addition, the geometry model for simple
features also allows geometries that are collections of other geometries
(either homogeneous multi-point, multi-line string and multi-polygon
collections, or heterogeneous geometry collections). In all cases the
'parent' geometry element is responsible for indicating in which SRS the
measurements have been made.



How can GML be used to represent real-world phenomena? Suppose somebody
wishes to build a digital representation of the city of Cambridge in England.
The city could be represented as a feature collection where the individual
features represent such things as rivers, roads and colleges; such a
classification of real world phenomena determines the feature types that need
to be defined. The choice of classification is related to the task to which
the digital representation will ultimately be put. The River
feature type might have a property called name whose value must be
of the type 'string'. It is common practice to refer to the typed property;
thus the River feature type is said to have a string property
called name. Similarly, the Road feature type might
have a string property called classification and an integer property
called number. Properties with simple types (e.g. integer, string,
float, boolean) are collectively referred to as simple properties.



The features required to represent Cambridge might have geometry-valued
properties as well as simple properties. Just like other properties,
geometric properties must be named. So the River feature type
might have a geometric property called centerLineOf and the
Road feature type might have a geometric property called
linearGeometry. It is possible to be more precise about the type of
geometry that can be used as a property value. Thus in the previous examples
the geometric property could be specialised to be a line string property.
Just as it is common to have multiple simple properties defined on a single
feature type, so too a feature type may have multiple geometric
properties.



1.2   Feature and Geometry models



The abstract feature model used by the Open GIS Consortium is shown in
Figure 1.1 using Syntropy notation. While it is common practice in the
Geospatial Information (GI) community to refer to the properties of a feature
as attributes, this document refers to them as properties in order to avoid
potential confusion with the attributes of XML elements.




Figure 1.1: The abstract feature model





The 'Simple Features' model represents a simplification of the more
general model described in the OpenGIS Abstract Specification, this
simplification was the result of developing a number of implementation
specifications. There are two major simplifications:


		Features are assumed to have either simple properties (booleans,
    integers, reals, strings) or geometric properties; and

		Geometries are assumed to be defined in two-dimensional SRS and use
    linear interpolation between coordinates.





A number of consequences follow from these simplifications. For example,
simple features only provide support for vector data; and simple features are
not sufficiently expressive to explicitly model topology. This version of GML
addresses the first of these limitations in that it allows features to have
complex or aggregate non-geometric properties. Such complex properties may
themselves be composed of other complex and simple properties. Common
examples include dates, times, and addresses. It is expected that future
versions of GML will address the second of these limitations and provide more
elaborate geometry models.



The geometry object model for simple features (Figure 1.2) has an
(abstract) base Geometry class and associates each geometry object with a
spatial reference system (SRS) that describes the coordinate space in which
the object is defined. GML mirrors this class hierarchy but omits some
intermediate (i.e. non-leaf) types such as Curve, Surface, MultiSurface, and
MultiCurve.

2   Overview of GML








2.1   Design goals



GML was developed with a number of explicit design goals, a few of which
overlap the objectives of XML itself:


		provide a means of encoding spatial information for both data transport
    and data storage, especially in a wide-area Internet context;

		be sufficiently extensible to support a wide variety of spatial tasks,
    from portrayal to analysis;

		establish the foundation for Internet GIS in an incremental and modular
    fashion;

		allow for the efficient encoding of geo-spatial geometry (e.g. data
    compression);

		provide easy-to-understand encodings of spatial information and spatial
    relationships, including those defined by the OGC Simple Features
  model;

		be able to separate spatial and non-spatial content from data
    presentation (graphic or otherwise);

		permit the easy integration of spatial and non-spatial data, especially
    for cases in which the non-spatial data is XML-encoded;

		be able to readily link spatial (geometric) elements to other spatial
    or non-spatial elements.

		provide a set common geographic modeling objects to enable
    interoperability of independently-developed applications.





GML is designed to support interoperability and does so through the
provision of basic geometry tags (all systems that support GML use the same
geometry tags), a common data model (features/properties), and a mechanism
for creating and sharing application schemas. Most information communities
will seek to enhance their interoperability by publishing their application
schemas; interoperability may be further improved in some cases through the
use of profiles as outlined in section 7.



2.2   Schemas for geospatial data



In general terms a schema defines the characteristics of a class of
objects; in XML a schema also describes how data is marked up. GML strives to
cater to a broad range of users, from neophytes to domain experts interested
in modeling the semantics of geo-spatial information. Version 2.1 of GML is
compliant with the XML Schema Recommendation published by the W3C in two
parts on 2 May 2001 [XMLSchema1], [XMLSchema2]). GML has also been developed to be
consistent with the XML Namespaces Recommendation [XMLName]. Namespaces are used to distinguish the
definitions of features and properties defined in application-specific
domains from one another, and from the core constructs defined in GML
modules.



Geospatial feature types can be considered apart from their associated
schemas. That is, a Road type (or class) exists independently of
its schema definition whether it's expressed in terms of a DTD or an XML
Schema. In GML 2.1 geospatial types are captured as element names, but these
names assert the existence of model-level types separately from their XML
Schema encodings. Consider the following example: a Road type is
introduced in an application schema by declaring a global <Road>
element of a type named RoadType (<element name="Road"
type="RoadType"/>). We note the interplay of two perspectives: conceptual
and implementation. Declaring that width is a property of a
Road is a model-level assertion that says nothing about whether
width is a floating point number with two decimal places or simply an
integer--these are data and process characteristics at the implementation
level.



GML 2.1 specifies three base schemas for encoding spatial information. The
Geometry schema (geometry.xsd) replaces the DTD that appeared in GML 1.0.
This release provides an enhanced Feature schema that supports feature
collections (as feature types) and includes common feature properties such as
fid (a feature identifier), name and description.
The XLink schema provides the XLink attributes to support linking
functionality. Database implementations are required to provide an
application schema that defines the schema expressions for the geographic
features that they support, and these are derived from the definitions found
in the Feature schema.



The XML schema definition language provides a superset of the facilities
provided by the DTD validation mechanism defined in the XML 1.0
specification. XML Schema provides a rich set of primitive datatypes (e.g.
string, boolean, float, month), and it allows the creation of built-in and
user-defined datatypes. XML Schema offers several advantages when it comes to
constraining GML encodings:


		it enables the intermingling of different vocabularies using
  namespaces;

		it permits finer control over the structure of the type definition
    hierarchy; and

		it confers extensibility and flexibility via derived types and
    substitution groups





2.3   Graphical rendering



GML has been designed to uphold the principle of separating content from
presentation. GML provides mechanisms for the encoding of geographic feature
data without regard to how the data may be presented to a human reader. Since
GML is an XML application, it can be readily styled into a variety of
presentation formats including vector and raster graphics, text, sound and
voice. Generation of graphical output such as maps is one of the most common
presentations of GML and this can be accomplished in a variety of ways
including direct rendering by graphical applets or styling into an XML
graphics technology (e.g. SVG [SVG] or X3D [X3D]). It should be noted that GML is not dependent on
any particular XML graphical specification.



3 The conceptual framework








3.1   Features and properties



GML is an XML encoding for geographic features. In order to correctly
interpret a GML document it is necessary to understand the conceptual model
that underlies GML, which is described in the OGC Abstract Specification.



3.1.1 Object Model



A geographic feature is essentially a named list of properties. Some or
all of these properties may be geospatial, describing the position and shape
of the feature. Each feature has a type, which is equivalent to a
class in object modeling terminology, such that the class-definition
prescribes the named properties that a particular feature of that type is
required to have. So a Road might be defined to have a name, a
surface-construction, a destination, and a centreLine. The properties
themselves are modeled in UML as associations, or as
attributes, of the feature class. The feature property type is given
by the rolename from an association, or by the attribute
name. The values of the properties are themselves also
instances of defined classes or types. So the Road name is a text-string, the
surface-construction might be a text token selected from an enumerated list,
the destination is another feature of type Town, and the centreLine is a
LineString, which is a geometry property.



In UML it is partly a matter of taste whether a property is represented as
an association or attribute, though it is common for a property with a
complex or highly structured type to be modeled as an association, while
simple properties are typically class attributes. If the value of a property
only exists in the presence of the feature, such as the Road name, then it
may use either a UML composition association or be represented as an
attribute, as these two methods are functionally equivalent. However, if the
value of a property is loosely bound to the object and the property value is
an object that might exist independently of the feature, such as the Town
that is the destination of a Road, then it must use a form of UML association
called aggregation (see Figure 3.1).




Figure 3.1: Composition and aggregation relationships





3.1.2 XML encoding of the object model



A feature is encoded as an XML element whose name is the feature type
according to some classification. The feature instance contains feature
properties, each as an XML element whose name is the property name. Each of
these contains another element whose name is the type of the property value
or instance; this produces a "layered" syntax in which properties and
instances are interleaved.



GML adopts a uniform coding convention to help distinguish properties from
instances: element names that represent instances of GML classes
start with an uppercase letter (i.e. using "upper camel-case notation"),
while tags that represent properties start with a lowercase letter
(i.e. using "lower camel-case notation"); all embedded words in the property
name start with uppercase letters (e.g. centerLineOf).



3.1.3 Functional view of the object model



From a functional perspective we can consider a property as a function
that maps a feature onto a property value. A property is characterised by the
input feature type and the type of the value that is returned. For example,
suppose the feature type House has a String property called
address and a Polygon property called extentOf. Using
functional notation we can then write:




address( House ) = String 

extentOf( House )= Polygon


This approach can also be applied to feature collections that have
features as members:




featureMember( FeatureCollection ) = Feature


3.2   Geometric properties



In general the definition of feature properties lies in the domain of
application schemas. However, since the OGC abstract specification defines a
small set of basic geometries, GML defines a set of geometric property
elements to associate these geometries with features.



The GML Feature schema also provides descriptive names for the geometry
properties, encoded as common English language terms. Overall, there are
three levels of naming geometry properties in GML:


		Formal names that denote geometry properties in a
    manner based on the type of geometry allowed as a property value

		Descriptive names that provide a set of standardised
    synonyms or aliases for the formal names; these allow use of a more
    user-friendly set of terms.

		Application-specific names chosen by users and defined
    in application schemas based on GML





The formal and descriptive names for the basic geometric properties are
listed in Table 3.1; these names appear in the Feature schema to designate
common geometric properties. The precise semantics of these geometry
properties (e.g. "What does position of an object mean?" or "Are location and
position synonymous?" ) is not specified.





Table 3.1: Basic geometric properties		Formal name		Descriptive name		Geometry type

		boundedBy		-		Box

		pointProperty		location, position, centerOf		Point

		lineStringProperty		centerLineOf, edgeOf		LineString

		polygonProperty		extentOf, coverage		Polygon

		geometryProperty		-		any

		multiPointProperty		multiLocation, multiPosition, multiCenterOf		MultiPoint

		multiLineStringProperty		multiCenterLineOf, multiEdgeOf		MultiLineString

		multiPolygonProperty		multiExtentOf, multiCoverage		MultiPolygon

		multiGeometryProperty		-		MultiGeometry







There are no inherent restrictions in the type of geometry property a
feature type may have. For example, a RadioTower feature type
could have a location that returns a Point geometry to identify its
location, and have another geometry property called extentOf that
returns a Polygon geometry describing its physical structure. A geometric
property can be modeled in UML as an association class. Figure 3.2
illustrates how the geometryProperty relation associates an abstract feature
type with an abstract geometry type.




Figure 3.2: Geometric properties as instances of an association class





In Figure 3.2 we also see that a pointProperty is a concrete
instance of GeometryProperty that links a feature instance with
a <Point> instance. An important point needs to be emphasized here: GML
uses property elements to carry the role name of an association; this
preserves important semantic relationships that would otherwise be
difficult--or impossible--to infer. Such a practice also helps to maintain
congruence between a GML schema and its corresponding UML model (if one
exists).



3.3   Application schemas



Three base XML Schema documents are provided by GML: feature.xsd which
defines the general feature-property model, geometry.xsd which includes the
detailed geometry components, and xlinks.xsd which provides the XLink
attributes used to implement linking functionality. These schema documents
alone do not provide a schema suitable for constraining data
instances; rather, they provide base types and structures which may be used
by an application schema. An application schema declares the actual
feature types and property types of interest for a particular domain, using
components from GML in standard ways. Broadly, these involve defining
application-specific types which are derived from types in the standard GML
schemas, or by directly including elements and types from the standard GML
schemas.



The base GML schemas effectively provide a meta-schema, or a set of
foundation classes, from which an application schema can be constructed.
User-written application schemas may declare elements and/or define types to
name and distinguish significant features and feature collections from each
other; the methods used to accomplish this are presented in section 4. A set
of (normative) guidelines and rules for developing an application schema
which conforms with GML are given in section 5. By following these rules and
deriving the types defined in an application schema from components in the
base GML schemas, the application schema benefits from standardised
constructs and is guaranteed to conform to the OGC Feature Model. A number of
complete examples appear in section 6.



The GML Geometry schema is listed in Appendix A. The <import>
element in the Geometry schema brings in the definitions and declarations
contained in the XLinks schema. The GML Geometry schema includes type
definitions for both abstract geometry elements, concrete (multi) point, line
and polygon geometry elements, as well as complex type definitions for the
underlying geometry types.



The GML Feature schema is listed in Appendix B. The <include>
element in the Feature schema brings in the definitions and declarations
contained in the Geometry schema; like the geometry schema, the Feature
schema defines both abstract and concrete elements and types.



4   Encoding GML








4.1   Introduction



This section describes how to encode geospatial (geographic) features in
GML. The encoding of spatial features using GML 2.1 requires the use of two
XML Schemas: the GML Feature Schema (feature.xsd) and the GML Geometry Schema
(geometry.xsd); with these two simple schemas it is possible to encode a wide
variety of geospatial information.



The remainder of this sub-section introduces the two XML Schemas using UML
notation. The following sub-sections provide an introduction to encoding
geospatial information in GML 2.1, broken down as follows:


		4.2 Encoding a feature without geometry

		4.3 Encoding geometry

		4.4 Encoding a feature with geometry

		4.5 Encoding collections of features

		4.6 Encoding associations between features





First-time readers may wish to skip this sub-section and proceed directly
to 4.2; starting from section 4.2 we present an extended set of examples
which progessively introduce the components of GML 2.1. Individuals wishing
to use GML as a simple means of structuring spatial information for transport
are referred to Listing 6.6.



4.1.1 The Geometry schema



The Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers a fairly general means of
visually representing the elements of an application schema; a class diagram
presents a concise overview of defined types, and a package diagram depicts
higher-level groupings of model elements. The base schemas can be viewed as
distinct packages with the dependencies as illustrated in Figure 4.1.




Figure 4.1: Base schemas as packages





The GML Geometry schema includes type definitions for both abstract
geometry elements, concrete (multi) point, line and polygon geometry
elements, as well as complex type definitions for the underlying geometry
types. Figure 4.2 is a UML representation of the Geometry schema; this
diagram provides a bridge between the wide-ranging OGC Abstract Specification
(Topic 1: Feature Geometry) and the GML Geometry schema--it includes
many of the 'well-known' structures described in the abstract
specification.




Figure 4.2: UML representation of the Geometry schema





The <<restriction>> stereotype applied to a generalization
relationship indicates that a subtype defined in the schema is derived by
restriction from its supertype. For example, the MultiLineString
class is a geometry collection in which a member must be a
LineString. The complete GML Geometry schema appears in Appendix
A; it is liberally documented with <annotation> elements. By
convention, explicity named type definitions take the corresponding class
name and append the 'Type' suffix (e.g. LineString becomes
LineStringType). Type names are in mixed case with a leading
capital; the names of geometric properties and attributes are in mixed case
with a leading lower case character. The names of abstract elements are in
mixed case with a leading underscore (e.g. _Feature) to highlight their
abstract character.



The Geometry schema targets the 'gml' namespace. A namespace is a
conceptual entity identified by a URI ("http://www.opengis.org/gml" for the
core gml namespace) that denotes a collection of element names and type
definitions that belong together--they comprise a cohesive vocabulary.
User-defined schemas are required to declare their own target namespace as
discussed in section 5.2.4.



4.1.2 The Feature schema



The Feature schema uses the <include> element to bring in the GML
geometry constructs and make them available for use in defining feature
types:



		<include schemaLocation="geometry.xsd"/>


      





Figure 4.3 is a UML representation of the Feature schema. Note that a
geometric property is modeled as an association class that links a feature
with a geometry; concrete geometric property types such as
PointProperty constrain the geometry to a particular type
(e.g.Point).




Figure 4.3: UML representation of the Feature schema





The GML Feature schema is listed in Appendix B. The <include>
element in the Feature schema brings in the definitions and declarations
contained in the Geometry schema. Like the geometry schema, the Feature
schema defines both abstract and concrete elements and types. User-written
schemas may define elements and/or types to name and distinguish significant
features and feature collections from each other.



4.2   Encoding features without
geometry



Although it is not anticipated that many features will be encoded in GML
2.1 without any geometry properties, this section starts off with a simple
example based on a non-spatial feature. This is referred to as the 'Dean'
example. There is a feature type called Dean that is defined to
have a string property called familyName and an integer property
called age. In addition a Dean feature can have zero or
more string properties called nickName. Thus a single instance of
the Dean feature type might be encoded in XML as:



		<Dean>
  <familyName>Smith</familyName>
  <age>42</age>
  <nickName>Smithy</nickName>
  <nickName>Bonehead</nickName>
</Dean>


      





Without any thought for GML, one could define the relevant XML Schema to
support this as:



		<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" />
<complexType name="DeanType">
  <sequence>
    <element name="familyName" type="string"/>
    <element name="age" type="integer"/>
    <element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
  </sequence>
</complexType>


      





However, using the Feature schema from GML, it is necessary to identify
what plays the role of features (and their types) and what plays the role of
properties. In the Dean example Dean is a feature type and
age is a property. This is indicated in GML by the following:



		<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature" />

<complexType name="DeanType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="familyName" type="string"/>
        <element name="age" type="integer"/>
        <element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





It should be noted that not only does the instance document validate
against both of these XML Schema definitions but the content model of
DeanType is the same in both XML Schema definitions. Using the
Feature schema from GML enables the use of pre-defined attributes. For
example features can be identified with the 'fid' attribute, and features can
be described using a predefined gml:description property. These
capabilities are inherited from gml:AbstractFeatureType (to be
more precise Dean extends
gml:AbstractFeatureType).



		<Dean fid="D1123">
  <gml:description>A nice old chap</gml:description>
  <familyName>Smith</familyName>
  <age>42</age>
  <nickName>Smithy</nickName>
  <nickName>Bonehead</nickName>
</Dean>


      





4.3   Encoding geometry



This section describes how GML encodes basic geometry types, and it
introduces the GML Geometry schema (geometry.xsd) that supports this
encoding. The geometry schema corresponds quite closely to the geometry
encoding embodied by the DTD put forth in the GML 1.0 document. The material
in this section should be read by all prospective GML users.



In accord with the OGC Simple Features model, GML provides geometry
elements corresponding to the following geometry classes:


		Point

		LineString

		LinearRing

		Polygon

		MultiPoint

		MultiLineString

		MultiPolygon

		MultiGeometry





In addition there are <coordinates> and <coord> elements for
encoding coordinates, and a <Box> element for defining extents. The
following sections describe in detail the encoding of each of these
fundamental types of geometry elements.



4.3.1 Coordinates



The coordinates of any Geometry class instance are encoded either as a
sequence of <coord> elements that encapsulate tuple components, or as a
single string contained within a <coordinates> element. The advantage
of using <coord> elements is that a validating XML parser can perform
basic type checking and enforce constraints on the number of tuples that
appear in a particular geometry instance. Both approaches can convey
coordinates in one, two, or three dimensions. The relevant schema fragments
can be found in the Geometry schema:



		<element name="coord" type="gml:CoordType" />

<complexType name="CoordType">
  <sequence>
    <element name="X" type="decimal"/>
    <element name="Y" type="decimal" minOccurs="0"/>
    <element name="Z" type="decimal" minOccurs="0"/>
  </sequence>
</complexType>


      





An additional level of constraint restricts the number of tuples by data
type. For example, a <Point> element contains exactly one coordinate
tuple:



		<Point srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <coord><X>5.0</X><Y>40.0</Y></coord>
</Point>


      





As an alternative, coordinates can also be conveyed by a single string. By
default the coordinates in a tuple are separated by commas, and successive
tuples are separated by a space character (#x20). While these delimiters are
specified by several attributes, a user is free to define a localized
coordinates list that is derived by restriction from
gml:CoordinatesType. An instance document could then employ the
xsi:type attribute to substitute the localized coordinates list
wherever a <coordinates> element is expected; such a subtype could
employ other delimiters to reflect local usage.



It is expected that a specialized client application will extract and
validate string content, as these functions will not be performed by a
general XML parser. The formatting attributes will assume their default
values if they are not specified for a particular instance; the
<coordinates> element must conform to these XML Schema fragments:



		<element name="coordinates" type="gml:CoordinatesType"/>

<complexType name="CoordinatesType">
  <simpleContent>
    <extension base="string">
      <attribute name="decimal" type="string" use="default" value="."/>
      <attribute name="cs" type="string" use="default" value=","/>
      <attribute name="ts" type="string" use="default" value="&#x20;"/>
    </extension>
  </simpleContent>
</complexType>


      





This would allow the Point example provided above to be encoded as:



		<Point srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <coordinates>5.0,40.0</coordinates>
</Point>


      





4.3.2   Geometry elements



The coordinates for a geometry are defined within some spatial reference
system (SRS), and all geometries must specify this SRS. GML 2.1 does not
address the details of defining spatial reference systems. There is an
existing OGC Recommendation that puts forth an XML-based specification for
handling coordinate reference systems and coordinate transformations [OGC01-014]. The srsName attribute of the
geometry types can be used to test for the equality of SRS between different
geometries. The srsName (since it is a URI reference) may be
resolved to retrieve the definition of the SRS.



The optional gid attribute of the geometry types represents a
unique identifier for geometry elements; this is an ID-type attribute whose
value must be text string that conforms to all XML name rules (i.e. the first
character cannot be a digit).



4.3.3   Primitive geometry elements



The Point element is used to encode instances of the
Point geometry class. Each <Point> element encloses either a single
<coord> element or a <coordinates> element containing exactly one
coordinate tuple; the srsName attribute is optional since a Point
element may be contained in other elements that specify a reference system.
Similar considerations apply to the other geometry elements. The Point
element, in common with other geometry types, also has an optional
gid attribute that serves as an identifier. Here's an example:



		<Point gid="P1" srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <coord><X>56.1</X><Y>0.45</Y></coord>
</Point>


      





The Box element is used to encode extents. Each
<Box> element encloses either a sequence of two <coord> elements
or a <coordinates> element containing exactly two coordinate tuples;
the first of these is constructed from the minimum values measured along all
axes, and the second is constructed from the maximum values measured along
all axes. A value for the srsName attribute should be provided,
since a Box cannot be contained by other geometry classes. A Box instance
looks like this:



		<Box srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <coord><X>0.0</X><Y>0.0</Y></coord>
  <coord><X>100.0</X><Y>100.0</Y></coord>
</Box>


      





A LineString is a piece-wise linear path defined by a
list of coordinates that are assumed to be connected by straight line
segments. A closed path is indicated by having coincident first and last
coordinates. At least two coordinates are required. Here's an example of a
LineString instance:



		<LineString srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <coord><X>0.0</X><Y>0.0</Y></coord>
  <coord><X>20.0</X><Y>35.0</Y></coord>
  <coord><X>100.0</X><Y>100.0</Y></coord>
</LineString>


      





A LinearRing is a closed, simple piece-wise linear path
which is defined by a list of coordinates that are assumed to be connected by
straight line segments. The last coordinate must be coincident with the first
coordinate and at least four coordinates are required (the three to define a
ring plus the fourth duplicated one). Since a LinearRing is used in the
construction of Polygons (which specify their own SRS), the srsName
attribute is not needed.



A Polygon is a connected surface. Any pair of points in
the polygon can be connected to one another by a path. The boundary of the
Polygon is a set of LinearRings. We distinguish the outer (exterior) boundary
and the inner (interior) boundaries; the LinearRings of the interior boundary
cannot cross one another and cannot be contained within one another. There
must be at most one exterior boundary and zero or more interior boundary
elements. The ordering of LinearRings and whether they form clockwise or
anti-clockwise paths is not important. A following example of a Polygon
instance has two inner boundaries and uses coordinate strings:



		<Polygon gid="_98217" srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <outerBoundaryIs>
    <LinearRing>
      <coordinates>0.0,0.0 100.0,0.0 100.0,100.0 0.0,100.0 0.0,0.0</coordinates>
    </LinearRing>
  </outerBoundaryIs>
  <innerBoundaryIs>
    <LinearRing>
      <coordinates>10.0,10.0 10.0,40.0 40.0,40.0 40.0,10.0 10.0,10.0</coordinates>
    </LinearRing>
  </innerBoundaryIs>
  <innerBoundaryIs>
    <LinearRing>
      <coordinates>60.0,60.0 60.0,90.0 90.0,90.0 90.0,60.0 60.0,60.0</coordinates>
    </LinearRing>
  </innerBoundaryIs>
</Polygon>


      





4.3.4   Geometry collections



There are a number of homogeneous geometry collections that are predefined
in the Geometry schema. A MultiPoint is a collection of
Points; a MultiLineString is a collection of LineStrings;
and a MultiPolygon is a collection of Polygons. All of these
collections each use an appropriate membership property to contain elements.
It should be noted that the srsName attribute can only occur on the
outermost GeometryCollection and must not appear as an attribute of any of
the enclosed geometry elements. Here's an example of a MultiLineString
instance with three members:



		<MultiLineString srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <lineStringMember>
    <LineString>
      <coord><X>56.1</X><Y>0.45</Y></coord>
      <coord><X>67.23</X><Y>0.98</Y></coord>
    </LineString>
  </lineStringMember>
  <lineStringMember>
    <LineString>
      <coord><X>46.71</X><Y>9.25</Y></coord>
      <coord><X>56.88</X><Y>10.44</Y></coord>
    </LineString>
  </lineStringMember>
  <lineStringMember>
    <LineString>
      <coord><X>324.1</X><Y>219.7</Y></coord>
      <coord><X>0.45</X><Y>4.56</Y></coord>
    </LineString>
  </lineStringMember>
</MultiLineString>


      





In addition the Geometry schema defines a heterogeneous geometry
collection represented by the MultiGeometry element that
provides a container for arbitrary geometry elements; it might contain any of
the primitive geometry elements such as Points, LineStrings, Polygons,
MultiPoints, MultiLineStrings, MultiPolygons and even other
GeometryCollections. The MultiGeometry element has a generic
geometryMember property which returns the next geometry element in
the collection. An example of a heterogeneous MultiGeometry instance appears
below.



		<MultiGeometry gid="c731" srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
  <geometryMember>
    <Point gid="P6776">
      <coord><X>50.0</X><Y>50.0</Y></coord>
    </Point>
  </geometryMember>

  <geometryMember>
    <LineString gid="L21216">
      <coord><X>0.0</X><Y>0.0</Y></coord>
      <coord><X>0.0</X><Y>50.0</Y></coord>
      <coord><X>100.0</X><Y>50.0</Y></coord>
    </LineString>
  </geometryMember>

  <geometryMember>
    <Polygon gid="_877789">
      <outerBoundaryIs>
        <LinearRing>
          <coordinates>0.0,0.0 100.0,0.0 50.0,100.0 0.0,0.0</coordinates>
        </LinearRing>
      </outerBoundaryIs>
    </Polygon>
  </geometryMember>
</MultiGeometry>


      





4.4   Encoding features with
geometry



GML 2.1 provides a pre-defined set of geometry properties that can be used
to relate geometries of particular types to features. Consider the case where
the DeanType feature definition has a point property called
location, which is one of the pre-defined descriptive names that can
substitute for the formal name pointProperty.



		<Dean>
  <familyName>Smith</familyName>
  <age>42</age>
  <nickName>Smithy</nickName> 
  <nickName>Bonehead</nickName>
  <gml:location>
    <gml:Point> 
      <gml:coord><gml:X>1.0</gml:X><gml:Y>1.0</gml:Y></gml:coord>
    </gml:Point>
  <gml:location>
</Dean>


      





which is based on the following application schema fragment:



		<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>

<complexType name="DeanType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="familyName" type="string"/>
        <element name="age" type="integer"/>
        <element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" 
          maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <element ref="gml:location"/> 
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





Alternatively one can define geometry properties specific to an
application schema. For example one might wish to name the property
specifying the location of the Dean instance as
deanLocation:



		<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>

<complexType name="DeanType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="familyName" type="string"/>
        <element name="age" type="integer"/>
        <element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" 
          maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <element name="deanLocation" type="gml:PointPropertyType"/>
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





In this example gml:PointPropertyType is available as a
useful pre-defined property type for a feature to employ in just the same way
that strings and integers are. The local declaration of the
<deanLocation> element basically establishes an alias for
<gml:pointProperty> as a subelement of Dean.



The exclusive use of globally-scoped element declarations reflects a
different authoring style that 'pools' all elements in the same symbol space
(see section 2.5 of the XML Schema specification, Part 1 for further
details); this style also allows us to assign elements to a substitution
group such that designated elements can substitute for a particular head
element, which must be declared as a global element. The
deanLocation property would be declared globally and referenced in a
type definition as shown below:



		<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>
<element name="deanLocation" type="gml:PointPropertyType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:pointProperty"/>

<complexType name="DeanType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="familyName" type="string"/>
        <element name="age" type="integer"/>
        <element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <element ref="ex:deanLocation" />
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





4.5   Encoding feature collections



GML 2.1 provides support for building feature collections. An element in
an application schema that plays the role of a feature collection must derive
from gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType and declare that it can
substitute for the (abstract) <gml:_FeatureCollection> element. A
feature collection can use the featureMember property to show
containment of other features and/or feature collections.



Consider the 'Cambridge' example (described in Section 5) where a
CityModel feature collection contains Road and
River feature members. In this modification to the example the
features are contained within the CityModel using the generic
gml:featureMember property that instantiates the
gml:FeatureAssociationType:



		<CityModel fid="Cm1456">
  <dateCreated>2000-02</dateCreated>
  <gml:featureMember>
    <River fid="Rv567">....</River>
  </gml:featureMember> 

  <gml:featureMember>
    <River fid="Rv568">....</River>
  </gml:featureMember>

  <gml:featureMember>
    <Road fid="Rd812">....</Road>
  </gml:featureMember>
</CityModel>


      





With the following associated application schema fragments:



		<element name="CityModel" type="ex:CityModelType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:_FeatureCollection"/>
<element name="River" type="ex:RiverType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>
<element name="Road" type="ex:RoadType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>

<complexType name="CityModelType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="dateCreated" type="gMonth"/>
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>

<complexType name="RiverType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>....</sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>

<complexType name="RoadType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>.....</sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





GML 2.1 provides a mechanism for feature identification. All GML features
have an optional 'fid' attribute of type ID inherited from
gml:AbstractFeatureType; this means that features in the same
GML document cannot share a 'fid' value. The 'fid' attribute and simple link
elements constructed using XLink attributes provide a means of unambiguously
referencing specific features within a GML document.



Within a feature collection, a <featureMember> element can either
contain a single feature or point to a feature that is stored remotely
(including elsewhere in the same document). A simple link element can be
constructed by including a specific set of XLink attributes. The XML Linking
Language (XLink) is currently a Proposed Recommendation of the World Wide Web
Consortium [XLink]. XLink allows elements to be
inserted into XML documents so as to create sophisticated links between
resources; such links can be used to reference remote properties.



A simple link element can be used to implement pointer functionality, and
this functionality has been built into various GML 2.1 elements by including
the gml:AssociationAttributeGroup in these constructs:


		gml:FeatureAssociationType,

		the geometry collection types, and

		all of the pre-defined geometry property types.





As an example, we can modify the CityModel fragment shown
above to include a remote River members without making
any changes to the application schema.



		<CityModel fid="Cm1456">
  <dateCreated>Feb 2000</dateCreated>

  <gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple" 
    xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers.xml#Rv567"/>
    
  <gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple" 
    xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers.xml#Rv568"/>

  <gml:featureMember>
    <Road fid="Rd812">....</Road>
  </gml:featureMember>
</CityModel>


      





It should be noted that the featureMember property can both point
to a remote feature and contain a feature. It is not possible in XML
Schema to preclude this practice using a purely grammar-based validation
approach. The GML 2.1 specification regards a featureMember in this
state to be undefined.



The most basic syntax for a simple link is as follows:



		<propertyName xlink:type="simple"
  xlink:title="Description of target instance"
  xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/locations.xml#fragment_identifier" />


      





where the xlink:title attribute is optional. The xlink:href attribute must
point to an object whose type matches that of the value type of the property.
It is up to the application to validate that this is the case, an XML parser
would not place any constraints on the element linked to by the href
attribute.



To enhance clarity a new attribute defined in the 'gml' namespace is
introduced to supplement the basic XLink attributes: remoteSchema.
The remoteSchema attribute is a URI reference that uses XPointer
syntax to identify the GML schema fragment that constrains the resource
pointed to by the locator attribute; this additional attribute is included in
the gml:AssociationAttributeGroup and so is already available to
featureMember properties so that they can be expressed like this
(assuming "RiverType" is the value of some identifier):



		<gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple"
  gml:remoteSchema="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/types.xsd#RiverType"
  xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers#Rv567"/>


      





XLink attributes can only be placed on property elements,
and there are no constraints on the values of the xlink:title attribute.
Simple XLinks also allow the use of the xlink:role attribute. However this is
most commonly a reflection of the property (for example the
featureMember role name) that is using the link.



The XLink specification requires that the xlink:href attribute point to
the resource participating in the link by providing a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI). For example, such a URI may constitute a request to a
remote server such as an OGC Web Feature Server (WFS). It might be noted that
in response to a 'GETFEATURE' request a WFS will return the GML description
of a feature, provided the feature identifier (the value of its 'fid'
attribute) is known:



		xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/wfs?WFSVER=0.0.12
  &amp;REQUEST=GETFEATURE
  &amp;FEATUREID=Rv567"


      





The value of the xlink:href must be a valid URI per IETF
RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and RFC 2732 [RFC2732]; as a consequence, certain characters in the
URI string must be escaped according to the URI encoding rules set forth in
the XLink specification and in the aforementioned IETF documents.



It might be noted that the WFS 'GETFEATURE' request returns a single
feature. If the gml:remoteSchema attribute is being used, then it
should point to the definition of the relevant feature type. Alternatively an
XLink can be used to encode an entire query request to a WFS (required
character references do not appear in the query string for clarity):



		xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/wfs?
  WFSVER=0.0.12&
  REQUEST=GETFEATURE&
  TYPENAME=INWATERA_1M&
  FILTER='<Filter>
            <Not>
              <Disjoint>            
                <PropertyName>INWATERA_1M.WKB_GEOM</PropertyName>
                <Polygon srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
                  <outerboundaryIs>
                    <LinearRing>
                      <coordinates>
                        -150,50 -150,60 -125,60 -125,50 -150,50
                      </coordinates>
                    </LinearRing>
                  </outerboundaryIs>
                </Polygon>
              </Disjoint>
            </Not>
          </Filter>'"


      





In this case the WFS may 'manufacture' a generic feature collection to
hold the results of the query. But since feature collections also have a
feature type, the gml:remoteSchema attribute (if used) should point
to the feature type definition of this feature collection, not the types of
the features returned by the query.



4.6   Encoding feature associations



The essential purpose of XML document structure is to describe data and
the relationships between components within it. With GML it is possible to
denote relationships either by containment or by linking, but there is no
a priori reason for preferring one style over another. The examples
presented so far have emphasized containment, generally using the property
name (i.e. the role name) as a 'wrapper' to make the logical structure
explicit.



The GML data model is based on three basic constructs: Feature, Feature
Type (i.e. Class), and Property. Both Classes and Properties are resources
that are independently defined in GML. A property is defined by specifying
the range and domain of the property, each of which must be defined GML
types. A GML feature is a Class on which are defined a number of properties;
zero, one, or more of these properties are geometry-valued. A
Resource is anything that has an identity [RFC2396]; this can include electronic documents, a
person, a service or a geographic feature.



In the previous section specialized links were used to allow a feature
collection in a GML document to contain features external to the document.
Had the features been present in the GML document, there would have been no
compelling reason to use a link, since the 'containment' relationship could
have been indicated by using nesting in the GML document. However there are
many relationships that cannot be encoded using containment. Consider the
'adjacency' relationship between three LandParcel features. In
total there are three relationships representing the three pairings of
features. Using the nesting approach encouraged so far, one might be tempted
to encode this in the following, albeit messy, way using an
adjacentTo property (we will present a much cleaner form later):



		<LandParcel fid="Lp2034">
  <area>2345</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
  <adjacentTo>
    <LandParcel fid="Lp2035">
      <area>9812</area>
      <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
      <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
      <adjacentTo>
        <LandParcel fid="Lp2036">
          <area>8345</area>
          <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
          <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
          <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>
        </LandParcel>
      </adjacentTo>
    </LandParcel>
  </adjacentTo>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>
</LandParcel>


      





In the above fragment the links are being used to identify features within
the same GML document. In this example the adjacency relationship is binary
(it connects pairs of features) and bi-directional (it can be navigated in
both directions). This has been achieved by using two adjacentTo
properties (each with a simple XLink) to represent each relationship. The
relationship itself has no identity in this encoding, and it is not possible
to record properties on the relationship. Relationships with these
characteristics are sometimes referred to as 'lightweight' relationships.



In the above encoding the adjacentTo property sometimes 'nests'
the related feature and sometimes 'points' to it. A more symmetrical version
of the above would be:



		<LandParcel fid="Lp2034">
  <area>2345</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>
</LandParcel>
....
<LandParcel fid="Lp2035">
  <area>9812</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>
</LandParcel>
....
<LandParcel fid="Lp2036">
  <area>8345</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>
</LandParcel>


      





Here the ellipses represent the necessary containment constructs holding
this set of LandParcels in some root feature collection. However
both examples conform to the same application schema:

A 'heavyweight' relationship provides identity for the relationship and an
opportunity to have properties on the relationship. To extend the adjacency
example, one might wish to have a heavyweight adjacency relationship
represented by an AdjacentPair feature type with the length of
the common border recorded as a commonBoundaryLength property. This
might be encoded in GML as:



		<LandParcel fid="Lp2034">
  <area>2345</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
</LandParcel>
....
<LandParcel fid="Lp2035">
  <area>9812</area>
  <gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
</LandParcel>
....
<AdjacentPair fid="Ad1465">
  <commonBoundaryLength>231</commonBoundaryLength>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
  <adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>
</Adjacent>


      





Note that in this example the AdjacentPair instances could
exist in a separate GML document from the LandParcel features
since the adjacentTo properties can point to features outside of the
GML document. Whether the instances are in a single or multiple documents,
they all conform to the same application schema:



		<element name="LandParcel" type="ex:LandParcelType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>
<element name="adjacentTo" type="ex:AdjacentToType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:featureMember"/>
<element name="AdjacentPair" type="ex:AdjacentPairType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>

<complexType name="LandParcelType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <element name="area" type="integer"/>
        <element ref="gml:extentOf"/>
        <!-- note adjacentTo has been removed -->
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>

<complexType name="AdjacentToType">
  <complexContent>
    <restriction base="gml:FeatureAssociationType">
      <sequence minOccurs="0">
        <element ref="ex:LandParcel"/>
      </sequence>
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
    </restriction>

        <element ref="ex:adjacentTo" minOccurs="2" maxOccurs="2"/>
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





The use of extended-type XLink elements offers a more concise means of
handling n-ary associations and support for creating third-party linkbases.
However, such topics are beyond the scope of this document and interested
readers are encouraged to consult the XLink specification for details.



5   GML application schemas








5.1   Introduction



The base schemas (Geometry, Feature, XLink) can be viewed as the
components of an application framework for developing schemas or sets of
schemas that pertain to a particular domain (e.g. Forestry), jurisdiction
(e.g. France), or information community.  Furthermore, such application
schemas may be developed in a more horizontal fashion to support many
information communities.



There are some basic conformance requirements that every application
schema must satisfy. Specifically, a conforming GML application schema must
heed the following general requirements:


		an application schema must adhere to the detailed schema development
    rules described in Section 5.2

		an application schema must not change the name, definition, or data
    type of mandatory GML elements.

		abstract type definitions may be freely extended or restricted.

		the application schema must be made available to anyone receiving data
    structured according to that schema.

		the relevant schemas must specify a target namespace that must
    not be http://www.opengis.net/gml (conventionally
    designated using the 'gml' namespace prefix).





A set of logically-related GML schemas, which we term the GML Framework,
is depicted in Figure 5.1. The GML schemas provide basic constructs for
handling geospatial data in a modular manner. A more specialized application
framework containing component application schemas would typically be created
for a particular theme or domain, but may also be quite horizontal in
nature.




Figure 5.1: GML as a core framework





5.2   Rules for constructing application
schemas (normative)



The following rules must be adhered to when constructing GML application
schemas.



5.2.1 Defining new feature types



Developers of application schemas can create their own feature or feature
collection types, but they must ensure that these concrete feature and
feature collection types are subtyped (either directly or indirectly) from
the corresponding GML types: gml:AbstractFeatureType or
gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType.



		<complexType name="MyFeature1Type">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <!-- additional child elements inserted here -->
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>

<complexType name="MyFeature2Type">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="foo:MyFeature1Type">
      <sequence>
        <!-- additional child elements inserted here -->
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





5.2.2 Defining new geometry types



Authors may create their own geometry types if GML lacks the desired
construct. To do this, authors must ensure that these concrete geometry and
geometry collection types are subtyped (either directly or indirectly) from
the corresponding GML types: AbstractGeometryType or
GeometryCollectionType:



		<complexType name="MyGeometry1Type">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractGeometryType">
      <sequence>
        <!-- additional child elements inserted here -->
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





Any user-defined geometry subtypes shall inherit the elements and
attributes of the base GML geometry types without restriction, but may extend
these base types to meet application requirements, such as providing a finer
degree of interoperability with legacy systems and data sets.



5.2.3 Defining new geometry properties



Authors may create their own geometry properties that encapsulate geometry
types they have defined according to subsection 5.2.2; they must ensure that
these properties are subtyped (either directly or indirectly) from
gml:GeometryPropertyType and that they do not change the
cardinality of the target instance, which must be a bonafide geometry
construct:



		<complexType name="MyGeometry1PropertyType">
  <complexContent>
    <restriction base="gml:GeometryAssociationType">
      <sequence minOccurs="0">
        <element ref="foo:MyGeometry1Type" />
      </sequence>
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
    </restriction>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





5.2.4 Declaring a target namespace



Authors must declare a target namespace for their schemas. All elements
declared in the schema, along with their type definitions, will reside in
this namespace. Validation will not succeed if the instance document does not
reside in the schema's target namespace. Note that it is not a requirement
that URIs actually point to anything concrete, such as a schema document;
namespaces are basically just a mechanism to keep element names distinct,
thereby preventing namespace 'collisions'.



To use namespaces, elements are given qualified names (QName) that consist
of two parts: the prefix is mapped to a URI reference and signifies
the namespace to which the element belongs; the local part conforms
to the usual NCName production rules from the W3C Namespaces
Recommendation:


NCName ::=  (Letter | '_') (NCNameChar)*
NCNameChar ::=  Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | CombiningChar | Extender



In each worked example the namespace for all elements is explicitly
indicated in order to show how vocabularies from different namespaces can
intermingle in a single instance document. The use of fully qualified names
is specified by setting the value of the elementFormDefault
attribute of <schema> to "qualified":



		<schema  targetNamespace="http://www.bar.net/foo"
         xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
         xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
         xmlns:foo="http://www.bar.net/foo"
         elementFormDefault="qualified"
         version="0.1">

  <!-- import constructs from the GML Feature and Geometry schemas -->
  <import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" schemaLocation="feature.xsd"/>
 . . .
</schema>


      





5.2.5 Importing schemas



A conforming instance document can employ constructs from multiple
namespaces, as indicated in Figure 5.2. Schema-A in the 'foo' namespace plugs
into the GML framework via the Feature schema (which also brings along the
geometry constructs). The Feature schema resides in the 'gml' namespace along
with the Geometry schema, so it uses the include mechanism. However,
since Schema-A targets a different namespace, it must employ the
import mechanism to use the core GML constructs.




Figure 5.2: Using schemas from multiple namespaces





Authors must bear in mind that the 'import' mechanism is the only means
whereby an application schema can bring in GML constructs and make use of
them. Since a conforming application schema cannot target the core GML
namespace ("http://www.opengis.net/gml"), other mechanisms such as 'include'
and 'redefine' cannot be employed.



5.2.6 Using substitution groups



Global elements that define substitution groups shall be used for both
class (e.g. feature, geometry etc.) and properties that are defined in GML
application schemas, and can substitute for the corresponding GML elements
wherever these are expected. Declare an element globally and specify a
suitable substitution group if the element is required to substitute for
another (possibly abstract) element; substitution groups thus enable type
promotion (i.e. treating a specific type as a more general supertype). The
following global declaration ensures that if foo:CircleType is a
defined geometry type, then a <Circle> element can appear wherever the
(abstract) gml:_Geometry element is expected:



		<schema . . .>
  <element name="Circle" type="foo:CircleType" 
    substitutionGroup="gml:_Geometry" />
  . . .
</schema>


      





Identical elements declared in more than one complex type definition in a
schema should reference a global element. If the <Circle> element is
declared globally in the 'foo' namespace (as shown above), it is referenced
from within a type definition as follows:



		<complexType name="MyHubPropertyType">
  <complexContent>
    <restriction base="gml:GeometryAssociationType">
      <sequence minOccurs="0">
        <element ref="foo:Circle" />
      </sequence>
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
    </restriction>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





5.2.7 Declaring additional properties



Schema authors can use the built-in geometric properties or derive their
own when necessary as shown in subsection 5.2.3. GML provides a number of
predefined geometric properties: location, centerLineOf,
extentOf, and so on. Authors can also apply a different name to a
base type and use it instead:



		<element name="crashSite" type="gml:PointPropertyType" 
  substitutionGroup="gml:pointProperty" />


      





A feature may also have properties that possess a more complex content
model (like geometry properties or feature members). It's important to keep
in mind that complex properties represent binary relationships, and that
property elements carry the role name of that association. In general, the
value of a property element must be one or more instances (either local or
remote) of some defined simple or complex type.



As an example, consider the inspectedBy property of a waste
handling facility that associates a <WasteFacility> instance with an
<Inspector> instance:



		<complexType name="WasteFacilityType">
  <complexContent>
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
      <sequence>
        <!-- other properties -->
        <element name="inspectedBy" type="foo:InspectedByType" />
      </sequence>
    </extension>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>

<complexType name="InspectedByType">
  <sequence minOccurs="0">
    <element ref="foo:Inspector"/>
  </sequence>
  <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup" />
</complexType>


      





The above fragment indicates that foo:InspectedByType
includes the simple-type XLink attributes (that are bundled up in
gml:AssociationAttributeGroup) to take advantage of the optional
pointer functionality; this can be useful if the same inspector assesses
multiple facilities and is the target of multiple references:



		<WasteFacility>
  . . .
  <inspectedBy xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="inspectors.xml#n124" />
</WasteFacility>


      





The definition of the Inspector type is not shown here, but
it must appear in some application schema. Furthermore, an inspector need not
be a feature instance--perhaps an inspector is a Person that
possesses properties such as an 'oid' identifier. Without the href
and other XLink attributes a valid instance might then look like the
following:



		<WasteFacility>
  . . .
  <inspectedBy>
    <Inspector oid="n124">. . .</Inspector>
  </inspectedBy>
</WasteFacility>


      





5.2.8 Defining new feature association types



Developers of application schemas can create their own feature association
types that must derive from gml:FeatureAssociationType. The
target instance must be a bonafide GML feature, and it may appear once
(explicitly minOccurs="0", implicitly maxOccurs="1"):



		<complexType name="MyFeatureAssociationType">
  <complexContent>
    <restriction base="gml:FeatureAssociationType">
      <sequence minOccurs="0">
        <element ref="foo:MyFeature1Type" />
      </sequence>
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
    </restriction>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


      





In many cases it may be desirable to allow instances of only certain
feature types as members of a feature collection. A Feature Filter
as described below shall be applied to ensure that only properly labeled
features are valid members.



Feature Filter		Intent:


      

		Restrict membership in a feature collection to permit only
        instances of specified feature types as allowable members.

		Also Known As:


      

		Barbarians at the Gate

		Motivation:


      

		Feature collections that extend
        gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType are somewhat
        'promiscuous' in that they will accept any concrete GML feature as an
        allowable member. A "Feature Filter" can be applied to ensure that
        only properly labeled features are valid members.


      

		Implementation:


      

				Declare a set of abstract elements to 'label' allowable members
            in a feature collection: 
            <element name="_SchoolFeature" type="gml:AbstractFeatureType"
  substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature" abstract="true"/>


          

		Define a filter by restricting
            gml:FeatureAssociationType: 
            <complexType name="SchoolMemberType">
  <complexContent>
    <restriction base="gml:FeatureAssociationType">
      <sequence minOccurs="0">
        <element ref="ex:_SchoolFeature"/>
      </sequence>
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>
    </restriction>
  </complexContent>
</complexType>


          

		Label allowable features as they are declared globally: 
            <element name="School" type="ex:SchoolType" 
  substitutionGroup="ex:_SchoolFeature"/>


          




      





6 Worked examples of application schemas
(non-normative)








This section presents several examples to illustrate the construction of
an application schema that employ the base GML schemas. All examples in this
section have been validated using the following suite of parsers:


		Apache Xerces (v2.0 beta 4--but it incorrectly complains about XPath
    predicates in URIs)

		Altova XML Spy (v4.2)

		Microsoft MSXML (v4.0)





Two examples are briefly summarized here and are explored in some depth
using UML class diagrams, corresponding GML application schemas, and sample
instance documents. One example is based on a simple model of the city of
Cambridge, and is described more fully in Box 1.1 below.



		Box 1.1: The Cambridge example

		This example has a single feature collection of type
        CityModel and contains two features using a containment
        relationship called 'cityMember'. The feature collection has a string
        property called dateCreated with the value '2000-11' and a
        geometric property called boundedBy with a 'Box' value. The
        Box geometry (which represents the 'bounding box' of the feature
        collection) is expressed in the SRS identified by the value of the
        srsName attribute: this URI reference points to a fragment
        in a remote XML document that contains information about the
        reference system.



        The first feature member is an instance of RiverType
        with the name "Cam" and description "The river that runs through
        Cambridge"; it has a geometric property called centerLineOf
        with a LineString value. The LineString geometry is expressed in the
        same SRS used by the bounding box.



        The second feature member is an instance of RoadType
        with description "M11". It has a string property called
        classification with value "motorway" and an integer property
        called number with value "11". The road has a geometric
        property called linearGeometry with a LineString value; this
        LineString geometry is also expressed in the same SRS used by the
        bounding box.


      





In the 'Cambridge' example the first feature member uses only standard
property names defined by GML, whereas the second feature member uses
application-specific property names. Thus this example will demonstrate how
GML is capable of being used in a custom application model, but it is not
intended to provide examples of how the various types of geometry are
encoded.



A second example will be used to illustrate how GML can represent a
hierarchy of feature collections; this will be referred to as the 'Schools'
example and it is summarized in Box 1.2.



		Box 1.2: The Schools example

		In this example we have a root feature collection of type
        StateType that contains two features collections
        (instances of SchoolDistrictType) using the pre-defined
        membership relationship 'featureMember'. The State collection also
        has a studentPopulation property. Each of the
        SchoolDistrict collections contains two School or
        College features using the membership relationship 'schoolMember'.



        A SchoolDistrict feature has a string property called
        name and a polygon property called extentOf. A
        School feature has a string property called
        address and a point property called location. A
        College feature also has a string property called
        address plus a point property called
        pointProperty.


      





Figure 6.1 is a UML diagram for the Cambridge example. As shown, allowable
city members must be Road or River instances; a
Mountain instance is not a valid member of the feature
collection.




Figure 6.1: UML diagram for the Cambridge example





Listing 6.1 is a custom city schema for the Cambridge example. The
explicit reference to "city.xsd" in the root element of the instance document
in Listing 6.2 (i.e. the value of the xsi:schemaLocation attribute)
is not required, but in this case it provides a hint to the validating parser
regarding the location of a relevant schema document.

Note that the application schema targets the namespace bound to the prefix
'ex' ; it imports the GML feature and geometry constructs from the 'gml'
namespace. The <boundedBy> element is defined in the Feature schema;
the <name> and <description> elements are also defined there. The
<CityModel> element is an instance of the user-defined
ex:CityModelType type that is derived by extension from
gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType. The types
ex:RiverType and ex:RoadType are both derived by
extension from gml:AbstractFeatureType, which is defined in the
GML Feature schema; these derivations assure that the application schema
conforms with the GML implementation specification of the OGC Simple Feature
model.



Listing 6.2 is a simple schema-valid instance document that conforms to
city.xsd. A few words of explanation about the <Mountain> feature are
in order! If this particular cityMember is uncommented in Listing 6.2, it
will raise a validation error because even though the mountain is a
well-formed GML feature, it is not recognized as a valid city
feature. Note that in city.xsd the <Road> and <River> features
are declared equivalent to ex:_CityFeature using the
substitutionGroup attribute; this abstract element functions as a
label that restricts membership in the <CityModel> feature
collection--only features so labeled are allowable members, as defined by
CityMemberType. This technique demonstrates the application of
the "Feature Filter" (see 5.2.7) that restricts membership in GML feature
collections.



One <cityMember> element in Listing 6.2 functions as a simple link
by employing several XLink attributes; in effect we have a pointer entitled
"Trinity Lane". Any <featureMember> element may behave as a simple link
that references a remote resource. The link can point to a document fragment
using an xpointer scheme that identifies a location, point, or range
in the target document [XPointer]. In this case
the value of the href attribute for the remote member contains an
HTTP query string that can retrieve the feature instance; the
remoteSchema attribute points to a schema fragment that constrains
the instance: namely, the complex type definition in city.xsd that bears the
name "RoadType".

Figure 6.2 is a UML diagram for the Schools example. The
SchoolDistrictclass is associated with the State
class via the featureMember relationship, and instances of the
Schoolor College classes are members of the
SchoolDistrict collection.




Figure 6.2: UML diagram for the Schools example





Listing 6.3 is an application schema for the Schools example. The purpose
of this example is to demonstrate that feature collections may indeed contain
other feature collections. To keep things fairly simple no attempt has been
made to restrict membership in any of the collections; this means that a
valid instance document could contain any GML feature within
the <State> and <SchoolDistrict> collections, not just those
pertaining to educational institutions. Sub-section 5.2.7 describes a design
pattern for restricting collection membership.

A few interesting things are happening in this example. The root
<State> element is an instance of ex:StateType, which is
derived from the abstract gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType
defined in the GML Feature schema. One of the child elements,
<SchoolDistrict>, is also a feature collection; in effect we have a
feature collection containing a feature collection as one of its members.
Listing 6.4 is a conforming instance document. Refer to Box 1.2 for a summary
of the example.

Note the use of <coord> elements to convey coordinate values; the
XML parser constrains the number of tuples according to geometry type. For
example, a <Point> element has exactly one coordinate tuple, and a
<LinearRing> has at least four.



The final example illustrates the construction of a "horizontal"
application schema in that it might be applied to a range of application
domains. This example is simple data interchange schema that facilitates the
exchange of application-level data structures (i.e. features and/or feature
collections); such a schema provides a generic means of transferring
instances of simple features.



Listing 6.5 is a sample instance document that conforms to the schema in
Listing 6.6. A feature may include any of the predefined simple geometric
properties (e.g. those that return Points, Polygons, or LineStrings).
Non-spatial properties must reflect one of the atomic datatypes of XML
Schema.

Listing 6.6 is the 'gmlpacket' schema. The <gmlPacket> element is
the root feature collection; this schema restricts allowable feature members
to instances of pak:StaticFeatureType. None of the type
definitions in the gmlpacket schema can be extended or restricted in any
manner, and this schema cannot serve as the basis for any other application
schema (i.e. it cannot be imported or included into another schema).

7 Profiles of GML








GML is a fairly complex specification that is rich in functionality. In
general an implementation need not exploit the entire specification, but may
employ a subset of constructs corresponding to specific relevant
requirements. A profile of GML could be defined to enhance interoperability
and to curtail ambiguity by allowing only a specific subset of GML; different
application schemas could conform to such a profile in order to take
advantage of any interoperability or performance advantages that it offers in
comparison with full-blown GML. Such profiles could be defined inside other
OGC specifications.



There may be cases where reduced functionality is acceptable, or where
processing requirements compel use of a logical subset of GML. For example,
applications that don't need to handle XLink attributes in any form can
adhere to a specific profile that excludes them; the constraint in this case
would be to not use links. Other cases might include defining constraints on
the level of nesting allowed inside tags (i.e. tree depth), or only allowing
features with homogeneous properties as members of a feature collection. In
many cases such constraints can be enforced via new schemas; others may be
enforced through procedural agreements within an information community.



Here are the guidelines for developing a profile:


		A profile of GML is a restriction of the basic descriptive capability
    of GML.

		Any such profile must be fully compliant with the GML 2.1
  specification.

		GML abstract type definitions may be freely extended or restricted.

		A profile must not change the name, definition, or data type of
    mandatory GML elements.

		The schema or schemas that define a profile must be made available to
    any application schemas which will conform to the profile.

		The relevant schema or schemas that define a profile must reside in a
    specified namespace that must not be
    http://www.opengis.net/gml (i.e. the core namespace for
  GML)

Appendix C:   The XLinks schema
(normative)








At the time that GML 2.1 was completed, the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) had not produced a normative schema to support the XLink
Recommendation. As an interim measure, this schema has been produced by the
editors of GML to provide the XLink attributes for general use; pending the
provision of a definitive schema by the W3C, this schema shall be considered
a normative component of GML 2.1.

        An abstract feature provides a set of common properties. A concrete 
        feature type must derive from this type and specify additional 
        properties in an application schema. A feature may optionally 
        possess an identifying attribute ('fid').

        A simple geometry property encapsulates a geometry element.
        Alternatively, it can function as a pointer (simple-type link) 
        that refers to a remote geometry element.
      
		
		 
			 
		
		 
              
  
   
     
       
        An instance of this type (e.g. a featureMember) can either 
        enclose or point to a feature (or feature collection); this 
        type can be restricted in an application schema to allow only 
        specified features as valid participants in the association. 
        When serving as a simple link that references a remote feature 
        instance, the value of the gml:remoteSchema attribute can be 
        used to locate a schema fragment that constrains the target 
        instance.

        a geometry element may have an identifying attribute (gid).

        These attributes can be attached to any element, thus allowing it 
        to act as a pointer. The 'remoteSchema' attribute allows an element 
        that carries link attributes to indicate that the element is declared 
        in a remote schema rather than by the schema that constrains the 
        current document instance.  
      
    
     
     
  
   
     
       
        An instance of this type (e.g. a geometryMember) can either 
        enclose or point to a primitive geometry element. When serving 
        as a simple link that references a remote geometry instance, 
        the value of the gml:remoteSchema attribute can be used to 
        locate a schema fragment that constrains the target instance.
      
    
     
       
    
    
     
     
  
   
     
       Restricts the geometry member to being a Point instance.
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
      
    
  
   
     
       Restricts the geometry member to being a LineString instance.
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
      
    
  
   
     
       Restricts the geometry member to being a Polygon instance.
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
      
    
  
   
     
       Restricts the outer or inner boundary of a polygon instance 
			to being a LinearRing.
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
        A Point is defined by a single coordinate tuple.
      
    
     
       
         
           
             
             
          
        
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A LineString is defined by two or more coordinate tuples, with 
        linear interpolation between them. 
      
    
     
       
         
           
             
             
          
        
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A LinearRing is defined by four or more coordinate tuples, with 
        linear interpolation between them; the first and last coordinates 
        must be coincident.
      
    
     
       
         
           
             
             
          
        
      
    
  
   
     
       
        The Box structure defines an extent using a pair of coordinate tuples.
      
    
     
       
         
           
             
             
          
        
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A Polygon is defined by an outer boundary and zero or more inner 
        boundaries which are in turn defined by LinearRings.
      
    
     
       
         
           
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
        A geometry collection must include one or more geometries, referenced 
        through geometryMember elements. User-defined geometry collections 
        that accept GML geometry classes as members must instantiate--or 
        derive from--this type.
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A MultiPoint is defined by one or more Points, referenced through 
        pointMember elements.
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
         
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A MultiLineString is defined by one or more LineStrings, referenced 
        through lineStringMember elements.
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
         
      
    
  
   
     
       
        A MultiPolygon is defined by one or more Polygons, referenced through 
        polygonMember elements. 
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
        Represents a coordinate tuple in one, two, or three dimensions.
      
    
     
       
       
       
    
  
   
     
       
        Coordinates can be included in a single string, but there is no 
        facility for validating string content. The value of the 'cs' attribute 
        is the separator for coordinate values, and the value of the 'ts' 
        attribute gives the tuple separator (a single space by default); the 
        default values may be changed to reflect local usage.

        The 'show' attribute is used to communicate the desired presentation

              presentation context
        replace - load the resource in the same window, frame, pane, or 
                  other presentation context

                 the starting resource 
        onRequest - traverse from the starting resource to the ending 
                    resource only on a post-loading event triggered for 
                    this purpose

Abstract 


The Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML encoding for the transport and storage of 
geographic information, including both the spatial and non-spatial properties of geographic features. 
This specification defines the XML Schema syntax, mechanisms, and conventions that 


! Provide an open, vendor-neutral framework for the definition of geospatial application schemas 
and objects;  


! Allow profiles that support proper subsets of GML framework descriptive capabilities;  
! Support the description of geospatial application schemas for specialized domains and 


information communities;  
! Enable the creation and maintenance of linked geographic application schemas and datasets;  
! Support the storage and transport of application schemas and data sets;  
! Increase the ability of organizations to share geographic application schemas and the 


information they describe.  


Implementers may decide to store geographic application schemas and information in GML, or they 
may decide to convert from some other storage format on demand and use GML only for schema and 
data transport. 


Document status 


This document is an OpenGIS® Recommendation Paper; while it constitutes a public statement of the 
official view of the OGC, it does not have the status of a Technology Specification. It is anticipated 
that the positions expressed in this document will evolve in concert with the underlying XML 
technologies. Although changes to this document are governed by a comprehensive review procedure, 
it is expected that some of these changes may be significant. Version 2.1 updates the GML 2.0 
schemas to conform with the current W3C Recommendation for XML Schema (dated 2001-05-02). 


XML instances which are compliant to this specification shall validate against a conforming 
application schema. A conforming application schema shall import the Geometry Schema 
(geometry.xsd), the Feature Schema (feature.xsd), and the XLinks schema (xlinks.xsd) as base 
schemas; furthermore, it shall be developed using the rules for the development of application

1 Representing geographic features 


 


1.1   Introduction 


This section introduces the key concepts required to understand how the Geography Markup 
Language (GML) models the world. It is based on the OGC Abstract Specification (available online: 
http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs.htm), which defines a geographic feature as "an abstraction of a 
real world phenomenon; it is a geographic feature if it is associated with a location relative to the 
Earth." Thus a digital representation of the real world can be thought of as a set of features. The state 
of a feature is defined by a set of properties, where each property can be thought of as a {name, type, 
value} triple. The number of properties a feature may have, together with their names and types, are 
determined by its type definition. Geographic features are those with properties that may be 
geometry-valued. A feature collection is a collection of features that can itself be regarded as a 
feature; as a consequence a feature collection has a feature type and thus may have distinct properties 
of its own, in addition to the features it contains. 


This specification is concerned with what the OGC calls simple features: features whose geometric 
properties are restricted to 'simple' geometries for which coordinates are defined in two dimensions 
and the delineation of a curve is subject to linear interpolation. While this release of GML does permit 
coordinates to be specified in three dimensions, it currently provides no direct support for three-
dimensional geometry constructs. The term 'simple features' was originally coined to describe the 
functionality defined in the set of OpenGIS® Implementation Specifications (available online: 
http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs.htm); GML follows the geometry model defined in these 
specifications. For example, the traditional 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometries defined in a two-
dimensional spatial reference system (SRS) are represented by points, line strings and polygons. In 
addition, the geometry model for simple features also allows geometries that are collections of other 
geometries (either homogeneous multi-point, multi-line string and multi-polygon collections, or

heterogeneous geometry collections). In all cases the 'parent' geometry element is responsible for 
indicating in which SRS the measurements have been made. 


How can GML be used to represent real-world phenomena? Suppose somebody wishes to build a 
digital representation of the city of Cambridge in England. The city could be represented as a feature 
collection where the individual features represent such things as rivers, roads and colleges; such a 
classification of real world phenomena determines the feature types that need to be defined. The 
choice of classification is related to the task to which the digital representation will ultimately be put. 
The River feature type might have a property called name whose value must be of the type 'string'. It 
is common practice to refer to the typed property; thus the River feature type is said to have a string 
property called name. Similarly, the Road feature type might have a string property called 
classification and an integer property called number. Properties with simple types (e.g. integer, string, 
float, boolean) are collectively referred to as simple properties. 


The features required to represent Cambridge might have geometry-valued properties as well as 
simple properties. Just like other properties, geometric properties must be named. So the River 
feature type might have a geometric property called centerLineOf and the Road feature type might 
have a geometric property called linearGeometry. It is possible to be more precise about the type of 
geometry that can be used as a property value. Thus in the previous examples the geometric property 
could be specialised to be a line string property. Just as it is common to have multiple simple 
properties defined on a single feature type, so too a feature type may have multiple geometric 
properties. 


1.2   Feature and Geometry models 


The abstract feature model used by the Open GIS Consortium is shown in Figure 1.1 using Syntropy 
notation. While it is common practice in the Geospatial Information (GI) community to refer to the 
properties of a feature as attributes, this document refers to them as properties in order to avoid 
potential confusion with the attributes of XML elements. 


Figure 1.1: The abstract feature model

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







 


The 'Simple Features' model represents a simplification of the more general model described in the 
OpenGIS Abstract Specification, this simplification was the result of developing a number of 
implementation specifications. There are two major simplifications: 


! Features are assumed to have either simple properties (booleans, integers, reals, strings) or 
geometric properties; and  


! Geometries are assumed to be defined in two-dimensional SRS and use linear interpolation 
between coordinates.  


A number of consequences follow from these simplifications. For example, simple features only 
provide support for vector data; and simple features are not sufficiently expressive to explicitly model 
topology. This version of GML addresses the first of these limitations in that it allows features to have 
complex or aggregate non-geometric properties. Such complex properties may themselves be 
composed of other complex and simple properties. Common examples include dates, times, and 
addresses. It is expected that future versions of GML will address the second of these limitations and 
provide more elaborate geometry models. 


The geometry object model for simple features (Figure 1.2) has an (abstract) base Geometry class and 
associates each geometry object with a spatial reference system (SRS) that describes the coordinate 
space in which the object is defined. GML mirrors this class hierarchy but omits some intermediate 
(i.e. non-leaf) types such as Curve, Surface, MultiSurface, and MultiCurve.

2   Overview of GML 


 


2.1   Design goals 


GML was developed with a number of explicit design goals, a few of which overlap the objectives of 
XML itself: 


! provide a means of encoding spatial information for both data transport and data storage, 
especially in a wide-area Internet context;  


! be sufficiently extensible to support a wide variety of spatial tasks, from portrayal to analysis;  
! establish the foundation for Internet GIS in an incremental and modular fashion;  
! allow for the efficient encoding of geo-spatial geometry (e.g. data compression);  
! provide easy-to-understand encodings of spatial information and spatial relationships, including 


those defined by the OGC Simple Features model;  
! be able to separate spatial and non-spatial content from data presentation (graphic or 


otherwise);  
! permit the easy integration of spatial and non-spatial data, especially for cases in which the non-


spatial data is XML-encoded;  


3: Conceptual framework Go


Page 7 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







! be able to readily link spatial (geometric) elements to other spatial or non-spatial elements.  
! provide a set common geographic modeling objects to enable interoperability of independently-


developed applications.  


GML is designed to support interoperability and does so through the provision of basic geometry tags 
(all systems that support GML use the same geometry tags), a common data model 
(features/properties), and a mechanism for creating and sharing application schemas. Most 
information communities will seek to enhance their interoperability by publishing their application 
schemas; interoperability may be further improved in some cases through the use of profiles as 
outlined in section 7. 


2.2   Schemas for geospatial data 


In general terms a schema defines the characteristics of a class of objects; in XML a schema also 
describes how data is marked up. GML strives to cater to a broad range of users, from neophytes to 
domain experts interested in modeling the semantics of geo-spatial information. Version 2.1 of GML 
is compliant with the XML Schema Recommendation published by the W3C in two parts on 2 May 
2001 [XMLSchema1], [XMLSchema2]). GML has also been developed to be consistent with the 
XML Namespaces Recommendation [XMLName]. Namespaces are used to distinguish the 
definitions of features and properties defined in application-specific domains from one another, and 
from the core constructs defined in GML modules. 


Geospatial feature types can be considered apart from their associated schemas. That is, a Road type 
(or class) exists independently of its schema definition whether it's expressed in terms of a DTD or an 
XML Schema. In GML 2.1 geospatial types are captured as element names, but these names assert the 
existence of model-level types separately from their XML Schema encodings. Consider the following 
example: a Road type is introduced in an application schema by declaring a global <Road> element of 
a type named RoadType (<element name="Road" type="RoadType"/>). We note the interplay of two 
perspectives: conceptual and implementation. Declaring that width is a property of a Road is a model-
level assertion that says nothing about whether width is a floating point number with two decimal 
places or simply an integer--these are data and process characteristics at the implementation level. 


GML 2.1 specifies three base schemas for encoding spatial information. The Geometry schema 
(geometry.xsd) replaces the DTD that appeared in GML 1.0. This release provides an enhanced 
Feature schema that supports feature collections (as feature types) and includes common feature 
properties such as fid (a feature identifier), name and description. The XLink schema provides the 
XLink attributes to support linking functionality. Database implementations are required to provide an 
application schema that defines the schema expressions for the geographic features that they support, 
and these are derived from the definitions found in the Feature schema. 


The XML schema definition language provides a superset of the facilities provided by the DTD 
validation mechanism defined in the XML 1.0 specification. XML Schema provides a rich set of 
primitive datatypes (e.g. string, boolean, float, month), and it allows the creation of built-in and user-


Page 8 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







defined datatypes. XML Schema offers several advantages when it comes to constraining GML 
encodings: 


! it enables the intermingling of different vocabularies using namespaces;  
! it permits finer control over the structure of the type definition hierarchy; and  
! it confers extensibility and flexibility via derived types and substitution groups  


2.3   Graphical rendering 


GML has been designed to uphold the principle of separating content from presentation. GML 
provides mechanisms for the encoding of geographic feature data without regard to how the data may 
be presented to a human reader. Since GML is an XML application, it can be readily styled into a 
variety of presentation formats including vector and raster graphics, text, sound and voice. Generation 
of graphical output such as maps is one of the most common presentations of GML and this can be 
accomplished in a variety of ways including direct rendering by graphical applets or styling into an 
XML graphics technology (e.g. SVG [SVG] or X3D [X3D]). It should be noted that GML is not 
dependent on any particular XML graphical specification. 


3 The conceptual framework 


 


3.1   Features and properties 


GML is an XML encoding for geographic features. In order to correctly interpret a GML document it 
is necessary to understand the conceptual model that underlies GML, which is described in the OGC 
Abstract Specification. 


3.1.1 Object Model 


A geographic feature is essentially a named list of properties. Some or all of these properties may be 
geospatial, describing the position and shape of the feature. Each feature has a type, which is 
equivalent to a class in object modeling terminology, such that the class-definition prescribes the 
named properties that a particular feature of that type is required to have. So a Road might be defined 
to have a name, a surface-construction, a destination, and a centreLine. The properties themselves are 
modeled in UML as associations, or as attributes, of the feature class. The feature property type is 
given by the rolename from an association, or by the attribute name. The values of the properties are 
themselves also instances of defined classes or types. So the Road name is a text-string, the surface-
construction might be a text token selected from an enumerated list, the destination is another feature 
of type Town, and the centreLine is a LineString, which is a geometry property. 


4: Base schemas Go


Page 9 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







In UML it is partly a matter of taste whether a property is represented as an association or attribute, 
though it is common for a property with a complex or highly structured type to be modeled as an 
association, while simple properties are typically class attributes. If the value of a property only exists 
in the presence of the feature, such as the Road name, then it may use either a UML composition 
association or be represented as an attribute, as these two methods are functionally equivalent. 
However, if the value of a property is loosely bound to the object and the property value is an object 
that might exist independently of the feature, such as the Town that is the destination of a Road, then 
it must use a form of UML association called aggregation (see Figure 3.1). 


Figure 3.1: Composition and aggregation relationships 


 


3.1.2 XML encoding of the object model 


A feature is encoded as an XML element whose name is the feature type according to some 
classification. The feature instance contains feature properties, each as an XML element whose name 
is the property name. Each of these contains another element whose name is the type of the property 
value or instance; this produces a "layered" syntax in which properties and instances are interleaved. 


GML adopts a uniform coding convention to help distinguish properties from instances: element 
names that represent instances of GML classes start with an uppercase letter (i.e. using "upper camel-
case notation"), while tags that represent properties start with a lowercase letter (i.e. using "lower 
camel-case notation"); all embedded words in the property name start with uppercase letters (e.g. 
centerLineOf). 


3.1.3 Functional view of the object model 


From a functional perspective we can consider a property as a function that maps a feature onto a 
property value. A property is characterised by the input feature type and the type of the value that is 
returned. For example, suppose the feature type House has a String property called address and a 
Polygon property called extentOf. Using functional notation we can then write: 


Page 10 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







address( House ) = String  
extentOf( House )= Polygon 


This approach can also be applied to feature collections that have features as members: 


featureMember( FeatureCollection ) = Feature 


3.2   Geometric properties 


In general the definition of feature properties lies in the domain of application schemas. However, 
since the OGC abstract specification defines a small set of basic geometries, GML defines a set of 
geometric property elements to associate these geometries with features. 


The GML Feature schema also provides descriptive names for the geometry properties, encoded as 
common English language terms. Overall, there are three levels of naming geometry properties in 
GML: 


1. Formal names that denote geometry properties in a manner based on the type of geometry 
allowed as a property value  


2. Descriptive names that provide a set of standardised synonyms or aliases for the formal names; 
these allow use of a more user-friendly set of terms.  


3. Application-specific names chosen by users and defined in application schemas based on 
GML  


The formal and descriptive names for the basic geometric properties are listed in Table 3.1; these 
names appear in the Feature schema to designate common geometric properties. The precise 
semantics of these geometry properties (e.g. "What does position of an object mean?" or "Are location 
and position synonymous?" ) is not specified. 


Table 3.1: Basic geometric properties


Formal name Descriptive name Geometry type


boundedBy - Box


pointProperty location, position, centerOf Point


lineStringProperty centerLineOf, edgeOf LineString


polygonProperty extentOf, coverage Polygon


geometryProperty - any


multiPointProperty multiLocation, multiPosition, multiCenterOf MultiPoint


multiLineStringProperty multiCenterLineOf, multiEdgeOf MultiLineString

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







There are no inherent restrictions in the type of geometry property a feature type may have. For 
example, a RadioTower feature type could have a location that returns a Point geometry to identify its 
location, and have another geometry property called extentOf that returns a Polygon geometry 
describing its physical structure. A geometric property can be modeled in UML as an association 
class. Figure 3.2 illustrates how the geometryProperty relation associates an abstract feature type with 
an abstract geometry type. 


Figure 3.2: Geometric properties as instances of an association class 


 


In Figure 3.2 we also see that a pointProperty is a concrete instance of GeometryProperty that links 
a feature instance with a <Point> instance. An important point needs to be emphasized here: GML 
uses property elements to carry the role name of an association; this preserves important semantic 
relationships that would otherwise be difficult--or impossible--to infer. Such a practice also helps to 
maintain congruence between a GML schema and its corresponding UML model (if one exists). 


3.3   Application schemas 


Three base XML Schema documents are provided by GML: feature.xsd which defines the general 
feature-property model, geometry.xsd which includes the detailed geometry components, and 
xlinks.xsd which provides the XLink attributes used to implement linking functionality. These 
schema documents alone do not provide a schema suitable for constraining data instances; rather, they 
provide base types and structures which may be used by an application schema. An application 
schema declares the actual feature types and property types of interest for a particular domain, using 
components from GML in standard ways. Broadly, these involve defining application-specific types 
which are derived from types in the standard GML schemas, or by directly including elements and 


multiPolygonProperty multiExtentOf, multiCoverage MultiPolygon


multiGeometryProperty - MultiGeometry

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







types from the standard GML schemas. 


The base GML schemas effectively provide a meta-schema, or a set of foundation classes, from which 
an application schema can be constructed. User-written application schemas may declare elements 
and/or define types to name and distinguish significant features and feature collections from each 
other; the methods used to accomplish this are presented in section 4. A set of (normative) guidelines 
and rules for developing an application schema which conforms with GML are given in section 5. By 
following these rules and deriving the types defined in an application schema from components in the 
base GML schemas, the application schema benefits from standardised constructs and is guaranteed to 
conform to the OGC Feature Model. A number of complete examples appear in section 6. 


The GML Geometry schema is listed in Appendix A. The <import> element in the Geometry schema 
brings in the definitions and declarations contained in the XLinks schema. The GML Geometry 
schema includes type definitions for both abstract geometry elements, concrete (multi) point, line and 
polygon geometry elements, as well as complex type definitions for the underlying geometry types. 


The GML Feature schema is listed in Appendix B. The <include> element in the Feature schema 
brings in the definitions and declarations contained in the Geometry schema; like the geometry 
schema, the Feature schema defines both abstract and concrete elements and types. 


4   Encoding GML 


 


4.1   Introduction 


This section describes how to encode geospatial (geographic) features in GML. The encoding of 
spatial features using GML 2.1 requires the use of two XML Schemas: the GML Feature Schema 
(feature.xsd) and the GML Geometry Schema (geometry.xsd); with these two simple schemas it is 
possible to encode a wide variety of geospatial information. 


The remainder of this sub-section introduces the two XML Schemas using UML notation. The 
following sub-sections provide an introduction to encoding geospatial information in GML 2.1, 
broken down as follows: 


! 4.2 Encoding a feature without geometry  
! 4.3 Encoding geometry  
! 4.4 Encoding a feature with geometry  
! 4.5 Encoding collections of features  
! 4.6 Encoding associations between features  


First-time readers may wish to skip this sub-section and proceed directly to 4.2; starting from section 


5: Application schemas Go

4.2 we present an extended set of examples which progessively introduce the components of GML 
2.1. Individuals wishing to use GML as a simple means of structuring spatial information for transport 
are referred to Listing 6.6. 


4.1.1 The Geometry schema 


The Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers a fairly general means of visually representing the 
elements of an application schema; a class diagram presents a concise overview of defined types, and 
a package diagram depicts higher-level groupings of model elements. The base schemas can be 
viewed as distinct packages with the dependencies as illustrated in Figure 4.1. 


Figure 4.1: Base schemas as packages 


 


The GML Geometry schema includes type definitions for both abstract geometry elements, concrete 
(multi) point, line and polygon geometry elements, as well as complex type definitions for the 
underlying geometry types. Figure 4.2 is a UML representation of the Geometry schema; this diagram 
provides a bridge between the wide-ranging OGC Abstract Specification (Topic 1: Feature Geometry) 
and the GML Geometry schema--it includes many of the 'well-known' structures described in the 
abstract specification. 


Figure 4.2: UML representation of the Geometry schema 


Page 14 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







 


The <<restriction>> stereotype applied to a generalization relationship indicates that a subtype 
defined in the schema is derived by restriction from its supertype. For example, the 
MultiLineString class is a geometry collection in which a member must be a LineString. The 
complete GML Geometry schema appears in Appendix A; it is liberally documented with 
<annotation> elements. By convention, explicity named type definitions take the corresponding class 
name and append the 'Type' suffix (e.g. LineString becomes LineStringType). Type names are in 
mixed case with a leading capital; the names of geometric properties and attributes are in mixed case 
with a leading lower case character. The names of abstract elements are in mixed case with a leading 
underscore (e.g. _Feature) to highlight their abstract character. 


The Geometry schema targets the 'gml' namespace. A namespace is a conceptual entity identified by a 
URI ("http://www.opengis.org/gml" for the core gml namespace) that denotes a collection of element 
names and type definitions that belong together--they comprise a cohesive vocabulary. User-defined 
schemas are required to declare their own target namespace as discussed in section 5.2.4.

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







4.1.2 The Feature schema 


The Feature schema uses the <include> element to bring in the GML geometry constructs and make 
them available for use in defining feature types: 


Figure 4.3 is a UML representation of the Feature schema. Note that a geometric property is modeled 
as an association class that links a feature with a geometry; concrete geometric property types such as 
PointProperty constrain the geometry to a particular type (e.g.Point). 


Figure 4.3: UML representation of the Feature schema 


 


The GML Feature schema is listed in Appendix B. The <include> element in the Feature schema 
brings in the definitions and declarations contained in the Geometry schema. Like the geometry 


<include schemaLocation="geometry.xsd"/>

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







schema, the Feature schema defines both abstract and concrete elements and types. User-written 
schemas may define elements and/or types to name and distinguish significant features and feature 
collections from each other. 


4.2   Encoding features without geometry 


Although it is not anticipated that many features will be encoded in GML 2.1 without any geometry 
properties, this section starts off with a simple example based on a non-spatial feature. This is referred 
to as the 'Dean' example. There is a feature type called Dean that is defined to have a string property 
called familyName and an integer property called age. In addition a Dean feature can have zero or 
more string properties called nickName. Thus a single instance of the Dean feature type might be 
encoded in XML as: 


Without any thought for GML, one could define the relevant XML Schema to support this as: 


However, using the Feature schema from GML, it is necessary to identify what plays the role of 
features (and their types) and what plays the role of properties. In the Dean example Dean is a feature 
type and age is a property. This is indicated in GML by the following: 


<Dean>
<familyName>Smith</familyName>
<age>42</age>
<nickName>Smithy</nickName>
<nickName>Bonehead</nickName>


</Dean>


<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" />
<complexType name="DeanType">


<sequence>
<element name="familyName" type="string"/>
<element name="age" type="integer"/>
<element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>


</sequence>
</complexType>


<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType"
substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature" />


<complexType name="DeanType">
<complexContent>


<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
<sequence>


<element name="familyName" type="string"/>
<element name="age" type="integer"/>
<element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"


</sequence>
</extension>


</complexContent>
</complexType>

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







It should be noted that not only does the instance document validate against both of these XML 
Schema definitions but the content model of DeanType is the same in both XML Schema definitions. 
Using the Feature schema from GML enables the use of pre-defined attributes. For example features 
can be identified with the 'fid' attribute, and features can be described using a predefined 
gml:description property. These capabilities are inherited from gml:AbstractFeatureType (to be 
more precise Dean extends gml:AbstractFeatureType). 


4.3   Encoding geometry 


This section describes how GML encodes basic geometry types, and it introduces the GML Geometry 
schema (geometry.xsd) that supports this encoding. The geometry schema corresponds quite closely 
to the geometry encoding embodied by the DTD put forth in the GML 1.0 document. The material in 
this section should be read by all prospective GML users. 


In accord with the OGC Simple Features model, GML provides geometry elements corresponding to 
the following geometry classes: 


! Point  
! LineString  
! LinearRing  
! Polygon  
! MultiPoint  
! MultiLineString  
! MultiPolygon  
! MultiGeometry  


In addition there are <coordinates> and <coord> elements for encoding coordinates, and a <Box> 
element for defining extents. The following sections describe in detail the encoding of each of these 
fundamental types of geometry elements. 


4.3.1 Coordinates 


The coordinates of any Geometry class instance are encoded either as a sequence of <coord> elements 
that encapsulate tuple components, or as a single string contained within a <coordinates> element. 
The advantage of using <coord> elements is that a validating XML parser can perform basic type 
checking and enforce constraints on the number of tuples that appear in a particular geometry 


<Dean fid="D1123">
<gml:description>A nice old chap</gml:description>
<familyName>Smith</familyName>
<age>42</age>
<nickName>Smithy</nickName>
<nickName>Bonehead</nickName>


</Dean>

instance. Both approaches can convey coordinates in one, two, or three dimensions. The relevant 
schema fragments can be found in the Geometry schema: 


An additional level of constraint restricts the number of tuples by data type. For example, a <Point> 
element contains exactly one coordinate tuple: 


As an alternative, coordinates can also be conveyed by a single string. By default the coordinates in a 
tuple are separated by commas, and successive tuples are separated by a space character (#x20). 
While these delimiters are specified by several attributes, a user is free to define a localized 
coordinates list that is derived by restriction from gml:CoordinatesType. An instance document 
could then employ the xsi:type attribute to substitute the localized coordinates list wherever a 
<coordinates> element is expected; such a subtype could employ other delimiters to reflect local 
usage. 


It is expected that a specialized client application will extract and validate string content, as these 
functions will not be performed by a general XML parser. The formatting attributes will assume their 
default values if they are not specified for a particular instance; the <coordinates> element must 
conform to these XML Schema fragments: 


This would allow the Point example provided above to be encoded as: 


<element name="coord" type="gml:CoordType" />


<complexType name="CoordType">
<sequence>


<element name="X" type="decimal"/>
<element name="Y" type="decimal" minOccurs="0"/>
<element name="Z" type="decimal" minOccurs="0"/>


</sequence>
</complexType>


<Point srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">

4.3.2   Geometry elements 


The coordinates for a geometry are defined within some spatial reference system (SRS), and all 
geometries must specify this SRS. GML 2.1 does not address the details of defining spatial reference 
systems. There is an existing OGC Recommendation that puts forth an XML-based specification for 
handling coordinate reference systems and coordinate transformations [OGC01-014]. The srsName 
attribute of the geometry types can be used to test for the equality of SRS between different 
geometries. The srsName (since it is a URI reference) may be resolved to retrieve the definition of the 
SRS. 


The optional gid attribute of the geometry types represents a unique identifier for geometry elements; 
this is an ID-type attribute whose value must be text string that conforms to all XML name rules (i.e. 
the first character cannot be a digit). 


4.3.3   Primitive geometry elements 


The Point element is used to encode instances of the Point geometry class. Each <Point> element 
encloses either a single <coord> element or a <coordinates> element containing exactly one 
coordinate tuple; the srsName attribute is optional since a Point element may be contained in other 
elements that specify a reference system. Similar considerations apply to the other geometry elements. 
The Point element, in common with other geometry types, also has an optional gid attribute that 
serves as an identifier. Here's an example: 


The Box element is used to encode extents. Each <Box> element encloses either a sequence of two 
<coord> elements or a <coordinates> element containing exactly two coordinate tuples; the first of 
these is constructed from the minimum values measured along all axes, and the second is constructed 
from the maximum values measured along all axes. A value for the srsName attribute should be 
provided, since a Box cannot be contained by other geometry classes. A Box instance looks like this: 


A LineString is a piece-wise linear path defined by a list of coordinates that are assumed to be 
connected by straight line segments. A closed path is indicated by having coincident first and last 
coordinates. At least two coordinates are required. Here's an example of a LineString instance: 


</Point>


<Point gid="P1" srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
<coord><X>56.1</X><Y>0.45</Y></coord>


</Point>


<Box srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
<coord><X>0.0</X><Y>0.0</Y></coord>
<coord><X>100.0</X><Y>100.0</Y></coord>


</Box>

A LinearRing is a closed, simple piece-wise linear path which is defined by a list of coordinates that 
are assumed to be connected by straight line segments. The last coordinate must be coincident with 
the first coordinate and at least four coordinates are required (the three to define a ring plus the fourth 
duplicated one). Since a LinearRing is used in the construction of Polygons (which specify their own 
SRS), the srsName attribute is not needed. 


A Polygon is a connected surface. Any pair of points in the polygon can be connected to one another 
by a path. The boundary of the Polygon is a set of LinearRings. We distinguish the outer (exterior) 
boundary and the inner (interior) boundaries; the LinearRings of the interior boundary cannot cross 
one another and cannot be contained within one another. There must be at most one exterior boundary 
and zero or more interior boundary elements. The ordering of LinearRings and whether they form 
clockwise or anti-clockwise paths is not important. A following example of a Polygon instance has 
two inner boundaries and uses coordinate strings: 


4.3.4   Geometry collections 


There are a number of homogeneous geometry collections that are predefined in the Geometry 
schema. A MultiPoint is a collection of Points; a MultiLineString is a collection of LineStrings; and 
a MultiPolygon is a collection of Polygons. All of these collections each use an appropriate 
membership property to contain elements. It should be noted that the srsName attribute can only 
occur on the outermost GeometryCollection and must not appear as an attribute of any of the enclosed 
geometry elements. Here's an example of a MultiLineString instance with three members: 


<LineString srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">
<coord><X>0.0</X><Y>0.0</Y></coord>
<coord><X>20.0</X><Y>35.0</Y></coord>
<coord><X>100.0</X><Y>100.0</Y></coord>


</LineString>


<Polygon gid="_98217" srsName="http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#4326">

In addition the Geometry schema defines a heterogeneous geometry collection represented by the 
MultiGeometry element that provides a container for arbitrary geometry elements; it might contain 
any of the primitive geometry elements such as Points, LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPoints, 
MultiLineStrings, MultiPolygons and even other GeometryCollections. The MultiGeometry element 
has a generic geometryMember property which returns the next geometry element in the collection. 
An example of a heterogeneous MultiGeometry instance appears below.

GML 2.1 provides a pre-defined set of geometry properties that can be used to relate geometries of 
particular types to features. Consider the case where the DeanType feature definition has a point 
property called location, which is one of the pre-defined descriptive names that can substitute for the 
formal name pointProperty. 


which is based on the following application schema fragment: 


Alternatively one can define geometry properties specific to an application schema. For example one 
might wish to name the property specifying the location of the Dean instance as deanLocation: 


<Dean>
<familyName>Smith</familyName>
<age>42</age>
<nickName>Smithy</nickName>
<nickName>Bonehead</nickName>
<gml:location>


<gml:Point>
<gml:coord><gml:X>1.0</gml:X><gml:Y>1.0</gml:Y></gml:coord>


</gml:Point>
<gml:location>


</Dean>


<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>


<complexType name="DeanType">
<complexContent>


<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
<sequence>


<element name="familyName" type="string"/>
<element name="age" type="integer"/>
<element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0"


maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
<element ref="gml:location"/>

<element name="familyName" type="string"/>
<element name="age" type="integer"/>
<element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0"


maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
<element name="deanLocation" type="gml:PointPropertyType"/>


</sequence>
</extension>


</complexContent>
</complexType>

3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







In this example gml:PointPropertyType is available as a useful pre-defined property type for a 
feature to employ in just the same way that strings and integers are. The local declaration of the 
<deanLocation> element basically establishes an alias for <gml:pointProperty> as a subelement of 
Dean. 


The exclusive use of globally-scoped element declarations reflects a different authoring style that 
'pools' all elements in the same symbol space (see section 2.5 of the XML Schema specification, Part 
1 for further details); this style also allows us to assign elements to a substitution group such that 
designated elements can substitute for a particular head element, which must be declared as a global 
element. The deanLocation property would be declared globally and referenced in a type definition as 
shown below: 


4.5   Encoding feature collections 


GML 2.1 provides support for building feature collections. An element in an application schema that 
plays the role of a feature collection must derive from gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType and 
declare that it can substitute for the (abstract) <gml:_FeatureCollection> element. A feature collection 
can use the featureMember property to show containment of other features and/or feature collections. 


Consider the 'Cambridge' example (described in Section 5) where a CityModel feature collection 
contains Road and River feature members. In this modification to the example the features are 
contained within the CityModel using the generic gml:featureMember property that instantiates the 
gml:FeatureAssociationType: 


<element name="Dean" type="ex:DeanType" substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature"/>
<element name="deanLocation" type="gml:PointPropertyType"


substitutionGroup="gml:pointProperty"/>


<complexType name="DeanType">
<complexContent>


<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
<sequence>


<element name="familyName" type="string"/>
<element name="age" type="integer"/>
<element name="nickName" type="string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"
<element ref="ex:deanLocation" />


</sequence>
</extension>


</complexContent>
</complexType>


<CityModel fid="Cm1456">
<dateCreated>2000-02</dateCreated>
<gml:featureMember>


<River fid="Rv567">....</River>
</gml:featureMember>


<gml:featureMember>
<River fid="Rv568">....</River>

With the following associated application schema fragments: 


GML 2.1 provides a mechanism for feature identification. All GML features have an optional 'fid' 
attribute of type ID inherited from gml:AbstractFeatureType; this means that features in the same 
GML document cannot share a 'fid' value. The 'fid' attribute and simple link elements constructed 
using XLink attributes provide a means of unambiguously referencing specific features within a GML 
document. 


Within a feature collection, a <featureMember> element can either contain a single feature or point to 
a feature that is stored remotely (including elsewhere in the same document). A simple link element 
can be constructed by including a specific set of XLink attributes. The XML Linking Language 
(XLink) is currently a Proposed Recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium [XLink]. 
XLink allows elements to be inserted into XML documents so as to create sophisticated links between 
resources; such links can be used to reference remote properties.

A simple link element can be used to implement pointer functionality, and this functionality has been 
built into various GML 2.1 elements by including the gml:AssociationAttributeGroup in these 
constructs: 


! gml:FeatureAssociationType,  
! the geometry collection types, and  
! all of the pre-defined geometry property types.  


As an example, we can modify the CityModel fragment shown above to include a remote River 
members without making any changes to the application schema. 


It should be noted that the featureMember property can both point to a remote feature and contain a 
feature. It is not possible in XML Schema to preclude this practice using a purely grammar-based 
validation approach. The GML 2.1 specification regards a featureMember in this state to be 
undefined. 


The most basic syntax for a simple link is as follows: 


where the xlink:title attribute is optional. The xlink:href attribute must point to an object whose type 
matches that of the value type of the property. It is up to the application to validate that this is the 
case, an XML parser would not place any constraints on the element linked to by the href attribute. 


To enhance clarity a new attribute defined in the 'gml' namespace is introduced to supplement the 
basic XLink attributes: remoteSchema. The remoteSchema attribute is a URI reference that uses 
XPointer syntax to identify the GML schema fragment that constrains the resource pointed to by the 
locator attribute; this additional attribute is included in the gml:AssociationAttributeGroup and so 
is already available to featureMember properties so that they can be expressed like this (assuming 
"RiverType" is the value of some identifier): 


<CityModel fid="Cm1456">
<dateCreated>Feb 2000</dateCreated>


<gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple"
xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers.xml#Rv567"/>


<gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple"
xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers.xml#Rv568"/>


<gml:featureMember>
<Road fid="Rd812">....</Road>


</gml:featureMember>
</CityModel>


<propertyName xlink:type="simple"
xlink:title="Description of target instance"
xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/locations.xml#fragment_identifier" />


Page 26 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







XLink attributes can only be placed on property elements, and there are no constraints on the values 
of the xlink:title attribute. Simple XLinks also allow the use of the xlink:role attribute. However this 
is most commonly a reflection of the property (for example the featureMember role name) that is 
using the link. 


The XLink specification requires that the xlink:href attribute point to the resource participating in the 
link by providing a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). For example, such a URI may constitute a 
request to a remote server such as an OGC Web Feature Server (WFS). It might be noted that in 
response to a 'GETFEATURE' request a WFS will return the GML description of a feature, provided 
the feature identifier (the value of its 'fid' attribute) is known: 


The value of the xlink:href must be a valid URI per IETF RFC 2396 [RFC2396] and RFC 2732 
[RFC2732]; as a consequence, certain characters in the URI string must be escaped according to the 
URI encoding rules set forth in the XLink specification and in the aforementioned IETF documents. 


It might be noted that the WFS 'GETFEATURE' request returns a single feature. If the 
gml:remoteSchema attribute is being used, then it should point to the definition of the relevant feature 
type. Alternatively an XLink can be used to encode an entire query request to a WFS (required 
character references do not appear in the query string for clarity): 


<gml:featureMember xlink:type="simple"
gml:remoteSchema="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/types.xsd#RiverType"
xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/rivers#Rv567"/>


xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/wfs?WFSVER=0.0.12
&amp;REQUEST=GETFEATURE
&amp;FEATUREID=Rv567"


xlink:href="http://www.myfavoritesite.com/wfs?
WFSVER=0.0.12&

In this case the WFS may 'manufacture' a generic feature collection to hold the results of the query. 
But since feature collections also have a feature type, the gml:remoteSchema attribute (if used) should 
point to the feature type definition of this feature collection, not the types of the features returned by 
the query. 


4.6   Encoding feature associations 


The essential purpose of XML document structure is to describe data and the relationships between 
components within it. With GML it is possible to denote relationships either by containment or by 
linking, but there is no a priori reason for preferring one style over another. The examples presented 
so far have emphasized containment, generally using the property name (i.e. the role name) as a 
'wrapper' to make the logical structure explicit. 


The GML data model is based on three basic constructs: Feature, Feature Type (i.e. Class), and 
Property. Both Classes and Properties are resources that are independently defined in GML. A 
property is defined by specifying the range and domain of the property, each of which must be 
defined GML types. A GML feature is a Class on which are defined a number of properties; zero, 
one, or more of these properties are geometry-valued. A Resource is anything that has an identity 
[RFC2396]; this can include electronic documents, a person, a service or a geographic feature. 


In the previous section specialized links were used to allow a feature collection in a GML document 
to contain features external to the document. Had the features been present in the GML document, 
there would have been no compelling reason to use a link, since the 'containment' relationship could 
have been indicated by using nesting in the GML document. However there are many relationships 
that cannot be encoded using containment. Consider the 'adjacency' relationship between three 
LandParcel features. In total there are three relationships representing the three pairings of features. 
Using the nesting approach encouraged so far, one might be tempted to encode this in the following, 
albeit messy, way using an adjacentTo property (we will present a much cleaner form later): 


<LandParcel fid="Lp2034">
<area>2345</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo>


<LandParcel fid="Lp2035">
<area>9812</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
<adjacentTo>


<LandParcel fid="Lp2036">
<area>8345</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>


</LandParcel>
</adjacentTo>


</LandParcel>
</adjacentTo>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>


Page 28 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







In the above fragment the links are being used to identify features within the same GML document. In 
this example the adjacency relationship is binary (it connects pairs of features) and bi-directional (it 
can be navigated in both directions). This has been achieved by using two adjacentTo properties (each 
with a simple XLink) to represent each relationship. The relationship itself has no identity in this 
encoding, and it is not possible to record properties on the relationship. Relationships with these 
characteristics are sometimes referred to as 'lightweight' relationships. 


In the above encoding the adjacentTo property sometimes 'nests' the related feature and sometimes 
'points' to it. A more symmetrical version of the above would be: 


Here the ellipses represent the necessary containment constructs holding this set of LandParcels in 
some root feature collection. However both examples conform to the same application schema: 


</LandParcel>


<LandParcel fid="Lp2034">
<area>2345</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2035"/>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>


</LandParcel>
....
<LandParcel fid="Lp2035">


<area>9812</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2036"/>


</LandParcel>
....
<LandParcel fid="Lp2036">


<area>8345</area>
<gml:extentOf>...</extentOf>
<adjacentTo xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#Lp2034"/>

A 'heavyweight' relationship provides identity for the relationship and an opportunity to have 
properties on the relationship. To extend the adjacency example, one might wish to have a 
heavyweight adjacency relationship represented by an AdjacentPair feature type with the length of 
the common border recorded as a commonBoundaryLength property. This might be encoded in GML 
as: 


Note that in this example the AdjacentPair instances could exist in a separate GML document from

The use of extended-type XLink elements offers a more concise means of handling n-ary associations 
and support for creating third-party linkbases. However, such topics are beyond the scope of this 
document and interested readers are encouraged to consult the XLink specification for details. 


5   GML application schemas 


 


5.1   Introduction 


The base schemas (Geometry, Feature, XLink) can be viewed as the components of an application 
framework for developing schemas or sets of schemas that pertain to a particular domain (e.g. 
Forestry), jurisdiction (e.g. France), or information community.  Furthermore, such application 
schemas may be developed in a more horizontal fashion to support many information communities. 


There are some basic conformance requirements that every application schema must satisfy. 
Specifically, a conforming GML application schema must heed the following general requirements: 


1. an application schema must adhere to the detailed schema development rules described in 
Section 5.2  


2. an application schema must not change the name, definition, or data type of mandatory GML 
elements.  


3. abstract type definitions may be freely extended or restricted.  
4. the application schema must be made available to anyone receiving data structured according to 


that schema.

5. the relevant schemas must specify a target namespace that must not be 
http://www.opengis.net/gml (conventionally designated using the 'gml' namespace prefix).  


A set of logically-related GML schemas, which we term the GML Framework, is depicted in Figure 
5.1. The GML schemas provide basic constructs for handling geospatial data in a modular manner. A 
more specialized application framework containing component application schemas would typically 
be created for a particular theme or domain, but may also be quite horizontal in nature. 


Figure 5.1: GML as a core framework 


 


5.2   Rules for constructing application schemas (normative) 


The following rules must be adhered to when constructing GML application schemas. 


5.2.1 Defining new feature types 


Developers of application schemas can create their own feature or feature collection types, but they 
must ensure that these concrete feature and feature collection types are subtyped (either directly or 


Page 32 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







indirectly) from the corresponding GML types: gml:AbstractFeatureType or 
gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType. 


5.2.2 Defining new geometry types 


Authors may create their own geometry types if GML lacks the desired construct. To do this, authors 
must ensure that these concrete geometry and geometry collection types are subtyped (either directly 
or indirectly) from the corresponding GML types: AbstractGeometryType or 
GeometryCollectionType: 


Any user-defined geometry subtypes shall inherit the elements and attributes of the base GML 
geometry types without restriction, but may extend these base types to meet application requirements, 
such as providing a finer degree of interoperability with legacy systems and data sets. 


5.2.3 Defining new geometry properties 


Authors may create their own geometry properties that encapsulate geometry types they have defined 
according to subsection 5.2.2; they must ensure that these properties are subtyped (either directly or 
indirectly) from gml:GeometryPropertyType and that they do not change the cardinality of the target

<!-- additional child elements inserted here -->

</complexType>


<complexType name="MyGeometry1Type">

</extension>
</complexContent>


</complexType>


Page 33 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







instance, which must be a bonafide geometry construct: 


5.2.4 Declaring a target namespace 


Authors must declare a target namespace for their schemas. All elements declared in the schema, 
along with their type definitions, will reside in this namespace. Validation will not succeed if the 
instance document does not reside in the schema's target namespace. Note that it is not a requirement 
that URIs actually point to anything concrete, such as a schema document; namespaces are basically 
just a mechanism to keep element names distinct, thereby preventing namespace 'collisions'. 


To use namespaces, elements are given qualified names (QName) that consist of two parts: the prefix 
is mapped to a URI reference and signifies the namespace to which the element belongs; the local 
part conforms to the usual NCName production rules from the W3C Namespaces Recommendation: 


NCName ::= (Letter | '_') (NCNameChar)*
NCNameChar ::= Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | CombiningChar | Extender


In each worked example the namespace for all elements is explicitly indicated in order to show how 
vocabularies from different namespaces can intermingle in a single instance document. The use of 
fully qualified names is specified by setting the value of the elementFormDefault attribute of 
<schema> to "qualified": 


5.2.5 Importing schemas 


A conforming instance document can employ constructs from multiple namespaces, as indicated in 


<complexType name="MyGeometry1PropertyType">
<complexContent>


<restriction base="gml:GeometryAssociationType">
<sequence minOccurs="0">


<element ref="foo:MyGeometry1Type" />
</sequence>
<attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>


</restriction>
</complexContent>


</complexType>


<schema targetNamespace="http://www.bar.net/foo"
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
xmlns:foo="http://www.bar.net/foo"
elementFormDefault="qualified"
version="0.1">


<!-- import constructs from the GML Feature and Geometry schemas -->
<import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" schemaLocation="feature.xsd"/>


. . .
</schema>


Page 34 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







Figure 5.2. Schema-A in the 'foo' namespace plugs into the GML framework via the Feature schema 
(which also brings along the geometry constructs). The Feature schema resides in the 'gml' namespace 
along with the Geometry schema, so it uses the include mechanism. However, since Schema-A targets 
a different namespace, it must employ the import mechanism to use the core GML constructs. 


Figure 5.2: Using schemas from multiple namespaces 


 


Authors must bear in mind that the 'import' mechanism is the only means whereby an application 
schema can bring in GML constructs and make use of them. Since a conforming application schema 
cannot target the core GML namespace ("http://www.opengis.net/gml"), other mechanisms such as 
'include' and 'redefine' cannot be employed. 


5.2.6 Using substitution groups 


Global elements that define substitution groups shall be used for both class (e.g. feature, geometry 
etc.) and properties that are defined in GML application schemas, and can substitute for the 
corresponding GML elements wherever these are expected. Declare an element globally and specify a 
suitable substitution group if the element is required to substitute for another (possibly abstract) 
element; substitution groups thus enable type promotion (i.e. treating a specific type as a more general 
supertype). The following global declaration ensures that if foo:CircleType is a defined geometry 
type, then a <Circle> element can appear wherever the (abstract) gml:_Geometry element is expected: 


Identical elements declared in more than one complex type definition in a schema should reference a 


<schema . . .>
<element name="Circle" type="foo:CircleType"


substitutionGroup="gml:_Geometry" />
. . .


</schema>


Page 35 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







global element. If the <Circle> element is declared globally in the 'foo' namespace (as shown above), 
it is referenced from within a type definition as follows: 


5.2.7 Declaring additional properties 


Schema authors can use the built-in geometric properties or derive their own when necessary as 
shown in subsection 5.2.3. GML provides a number of predefined geometric properties: location, 
centerLineOf, extentOf, and so on. Authors can also apply a different name to a base type and use it 
instead: 


A feature may also have properties that possess a more complex content model (like geometry 
properties or feature members). It's important to keep in mind that complex properties represent 
binary relationships, and that property elements carry the role name of that association. In general, the 
value of a property element must be one or more instances (either local or remote) of some defined 
simple or complex type. 


As an example, consider the inspectedBy property of a waste handling facility that associates a 
<WasteFacility> instance with an <Inspector> instance: 


<complexType name="MyHubPropertyType">
<complexContent>


<restriction base="gml:GeometryAssociationType">
<sequence minOccurs="0">


<element ref="foo:Circle" />
</sequence>
<attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>


</restriction>
</complexContent>


</complexType>


<element name="crashSite" type="gml:PointPropertyType"
substitutionGroup="gml:pointProperty" />


<complexType name="WasteFacilityType">
<complexContent>


<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType">
<sequence>


<!-- other properties -->
<element name="inspectedBy" type="foo:InspectedByType" />


</sequence>
</extension>


</complexContent>
</complexType>


<complexType name="InspectedByType">
<sequence minOccurs="0">


<element ref="foo:Inspector"/>
</sequence>
<attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup" />


</complexType>


Page 36 of 68Geography Markup Language, v2.1.1


3/5/2002file://C:\Documents%20and%20Settings\gbuehler\Desktop\02-009\GML2-11.html







The above fragment indicates that foo:InspectedByType includes the simple-type XLink attributes 
(that are bundled up in gml:AssociationAttributeGroup) to take advantage of the optional pointer 
functionality; this can be useful if the same inspector assesses multiple facilities and is the target of 
multiple references: 


The definition of the Inspector type is not shown here, but it must appear in some application 
schema. Furthermore, an inspector need not be a feature instance--perhaps an inspector is a Person 
that possesses properties such as an 'oid' identifier. Without the href and other XLink attributes a valid 
instance might then look like the following: 


5.2.8 Defining new feature association types 


Developers of application schemas can create their own feature association types that must derive 
from gml:FeatureAssociationType. The target instance must be a bonafide GML feature, and it 
may appear once (explicitly minOccurs="0", implicitly maxOccurs="1"): 


In many cases it may be desirable to allow instances of only certain feature types as members of a 
feature collection. A Feature Filter as described below shall be applied to ensure that only properly 
labeled features are valid members. 


<WasteFacility>
. . .
<inspectedBy xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="inspectors.xml#n124" />


</WasteFacility>


<WasteFacility>
. . .
<inspectedBy>


<Inspector oid="n124">. . .</Inspector>
</inspectedBy>


</WasteFacility>

6 Worked examples of application schemas (non-normative) 


 


This section presents several examples to illustrate the construction of an application schema that 
employ the base GML schemas. All examples in this section have been validated using the following 
suite of parsers: 


! Apache Xerces (v2.0 beta 4--but it incorrectly complains about XPath predicates in URIs)  
! Altova XML Spy (v4.2)  
! Microsoft MSXML (v4.0)  


Two examples are briefly summarized here and are explored in some depth using UML class 
diagrams, corresponding GML application schemas, and sample instance documents. One example is 
based on a simple model of the city of Cambridge, and is described more fully in Box 1.1 below. 


allowable members.


Also Known As: 
Barbarians at the Gate


Motivation: 
Feature collections that extend gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType are somewhat 
'promiscuous' in that they will accept any concrete GML feature as an allowable member. A "Feature 
Filter" can be applied to ensure that only properly labeled features are valid members. 


Implementation: 
1. Declare a set of abstract elements to 'label' allowable members in a feature collection: 


<element name="_SchoolFeature" type="gml:AbstractFeatureType"
substitutionGroup="gml:_Feature" abstract="true"/>


2. Define a filter by restricting gml:FeatureAssociationType: 
<complexType name="SchoolMemberType">


<complexContent>
<restriction base="gml:FeatureAssociationType">


<sequence minOccurs="0">
<element ref="ex:_SchoolFeature"/>


</sequence>
<attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/>


</restriction>
</complexContent>


</complexType>


3. Label allowable features as they are declared globally: 
<element name="School" type="ex:SchoolType"


substitutionGroup="ex:_SchoolFeature"/>

In the 'Cambridge' example the first feature member uses only standard property names defined by 
GML, whereas the second feature member uses application-specific property names. Thus this 
example will demonstrate how GML is capable of being used in a custom application model, but it is 
not intended to provide examples of how the various types of geometry are encoded. 


A second example will be used to illustrate how GML can represent a hierarchy of feature collections; 
this will be referred to as the 'Schools' example and it is summarized in Box 1.2. 


Figure 6.1 is a UML diagram for the Cambridge example. As shown, allowable city members must be 
Road or River instances; a Mountain instance is not a valid member of the feature collection. 


Figure 6.1: UML diagram for the Cambridge example 


Box 1.1: The Cambridge example
This example has a single feature collection of type CityModel and contains two features using a 
containment relationship called 'cityMember'. The feature collection has a string property called 
dateCreated with the value '2000-11' and a geometric property called boundedBy with a 'Box' value. 
The Box geometry (which represents the 'bounding box' of the feature collection) is expressed in the 
SRS identified by the value of the srsName attribute: this URI reference points to a fragment in a 
remote XML document that contains information about the reference system. 


The first feature member is an instance of RiverType with the name "Cam" and description "The 
river that runs through Cambridge"; it has a geometric property called centerLineOf with a 
LineString value. The LineString geometry is expressed in the same SRS used by the bounding box. 


The second feature member is an instance of RoadType with description "M11". It has a string 
property called classification with value "motorway" and an integer property called number with 
value "11". The road has a geometric property called linearGeometry with a LineString value; this 
LineString geometry is also expressed in the same SRS used by the bounding box. 


Box 1.2: The Schools example
In this example we have a root feature collection of type StateType that contains two features 
collections (instances of SchoolDistrictType) using the pre-defined membership relationship 
'featureMember'. The State collection also has a studentPopulation property. Each of the 
SchoolDistrict collections contains two School or College features using the membership 
relationship 'schoolMember'. 


A SchoolDistrict feature has a string property called name and a polygon property called 
extentOf. A School feature has a string property called address and a point property called location. 
A College feature also has a string property called address plus a point property called 
pointProperty.

Listing 6.1 is a custom city schema for the Cambridge example. The explicit reference to "city.xsd" in 
the root element of the instance document in Listing 6.2 (i.e. the value of the xsi:schemaLocation 
attribute) is not required, but in this case it provides a hint to the validating parser regarding the 
location of a relevant schema document.

Note that the application schema targets the namespace bound to the prefix 'ex' ; it imports the GML 
feature and geometry constructs from the 'gml' namespace. The <boundedBy> element is defined in 
the Feature schema; the <name> and <description> elements are also defined there. The <CityModel> 
element is an instance of the user-defined ex:CityModelType type that is derived by extension from 
gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType. The types ex:RiverType and ex:RoadType are both 
derived by extension from gml:AbstractFeatureType, which is defined in the GML Feature 
schema; these derivations assure that the application schema conforms with the GML implementation 
specification of the OGC Simple Feature model. 


Listing 6.2 is a simple schema-valid instance document that conforms to city.xsd. A few words of 
explanation about the <Mountain> feature are in order! If this particular cityMember is uncommented 
in Listing 6.2, it will raise a validation error because even though the mountain is a well-formed GML 
feature, it is not recognized as a valid city feature. Note that in city.xsd the <Road> and <River> 
features are declared equivalent to ex:_CityFeature using the substitutionGroup attribute; this abstract 
element functions as a label that restricts membership in the <CityModel> feature collection--only 
features so labeled are allowable members, as defined by CityMemberType. This technique 
demonstrates the application of the "Feature Filter" (see 5.2.7) that restricts membership in GML 
feature collections. 


One <cityMember> element in Listing 6.2 functions as a simple link by employing several XLink 
attributes; in effect we have a pointer entitled "Trinity Lane". Any <featureMember> element may 
behave as a simple link that references a remote resource. The link can point to a document fragment 
using an xpointer scheme that identifies a location, point, or range in the target document [XPointer]. 
In this case the value of the href attribute for the remote member contains an HTTP query string that 
can retrieve the feature instance; the remoteSchema attribute points to a schema fragment that 
constrains the instance: namely, the complex type definition in city.xsd that bears the name 
"RoadType".

the State class via the featureMember relationship, and instances of the Schoolor College classes 
are members of the SchoolDistrict collection. 


Figure 6.2: UML diagram for the Schools example 


 


Listing 6.3 is an application schema for the Schools example. The purpose of this example is to 
demonstrate that feature collections may indeed contain other feature collections. To keep things 
fairly simple no attempt has been made to restrict membership in any of the collections; this means 
that a valid instance document could contain any GML feature within the <State> and 
<SchoolDistrict> collections, not just those pertaining to educational institutions. Sub-section 5.2.7 
describes a design pattern for restricting collection membership.

A few interesting things are happening in this example. The root <State> element is an instance of 
ex:StateType, which is derived from the abstract gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType defined 
in the GML Feature schema. One of the child elements, <SchoolDistrict>, is also a feature collection; 
in effect we have a feature collection containing a feature collection as one of its members. Listing 6.4 
is a conforming instance document. Refer to Box 1.2 for a summary of the example.

Note the use of <coord> elements to convey coordinate values; the XML parser constrains the number 
of tuples according to geometry type. For example, a <Point> element has exactly one coordinate 
tuple, and a <LinearRing> has at least four. 


The final example illustrates the construction of a "horizontal" application schema in that it might be 
applied to a range of application domains. This example is simple data interchange schema that 
facilitates the exchange of application-level data structures (i.e. features and/or feature collections); 
such a schema provides a generic means of transferring instances of simple features. 


Listing 6.5 is a sample instance document that conforms to the schema in Listing 6.6. A feature may 
include any of the predefined simple geometric properties (e.g. those that return Points, Polygons, or 
LineStrings). Non-spatial properties must reflect one of the atomic datatypes of XML Schema.

7 Profiles of GML 


 


GML is a fairly complex specification that is rich in functionality. In general an implementation need 
not exploit the entire specification, but may employ a subset of constructs corresponding to specific 
relevant requirements. A profile of GML could be defined to enhance interoperability and to curtail 
ambiguity by allowing only a specific subset of GML; different application schemas could conform to 
such a profile in order to take advantage of any interoperability or performance advantages that it 
offers in comparison with full-blown GML. Such profiles could be defined inside other OGC 
specifications. 


There may be cases where reduced functionality is acceptable, or where processing requirements 
compel use of a logical subset of GML. For example, applications that don't need to handle XLink 
attributes in any form can adhere to a specific profile that excludes them; the constraint in this case 
would be to not use links. Other cases might include defining constraints on the level of nesting 
allowed inside tags (i.e. tree depth), or only allowing features with homogeneous properties as 
members of a feature collection. In many cases such constraints can be enforced via new schemas; 
others may be enforced through procedural agreements within an information community. 


Here are the guidelines for developing a profile: 


1. A profile of GML is a restriction of the basic descriptive capability of GML.  
2. Any such profile must be fully compliant with the GML 2.1 specification.  
3. GML abstract type definitions may be freely extended or restricted.

4. A profile must not change the name, definition, or data type of mandatory GML elements.  
5. The schema or schemas that define a profile must be made available to any application schemas 


which will conform to the profile.  
6. The relevant schema or schemas that define a profile must reside in a specified namespace that 


must not be http://www.opengis.net/gml (i.e. the core namespace for GML)

Appendix C:   The XLinks schema (normative) 


 


At the time that GML 2.1 was completed, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) had not produced 
a normative schema to support the XLink Recommendation. As an interim measure, this schema has 
been produced by the editors of GML to provide the XLink attributes for general use; pending the 
provision of a definitive schema by the W3C, this schema shall be considered a normative component 
of GML 2.1.
