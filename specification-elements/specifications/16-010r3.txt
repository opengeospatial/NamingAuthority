1. Scope 

The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, versionable, 
simulation-rich, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides 
for a synthetic environment repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between data 
store authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a 
common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can 
simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their 
respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB data store is plug-and-play 
interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators.  A CDB data store can be readily used 
by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, 
Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-
demand in real-time. 

2. Conformance 

This is an informative document. There are no normative clauses 

3. References 

For ease of editing and review, the standard has been separated into 12 Volumes and a 
schema repository.

6. Data Model Guidance 

6.1 Guideline: Creating a 3D Model for a Powerline Pylon 
Formerly Annex A.1 Volume 2 of the CDB Best Practice 



9 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The goal of this guidance is to model a typical high voltage electrical pylon resembling 
the one in the following figure. This guideline is based on version 3.1 of the CDB Best 
Practice, but is applicable to version 3.0 as well1. 

 

 
Figure 6-1: Typical Electrical Pylon 

 

6.1.1 Pylon Model Orientation 
The front (and back) of a powerline pylon is aligned with the general direction of the 
attached wires as illustrated below.

the OGC

Figure 6-2: Pylon Orientation 

 
The above snapshot is similar to the one found in Figure 6–10 of CDB Best Practice - 
Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using OpenFlight. 

6.1.2 OpenFlight Graph 
The OpenFlight graph of the above pylon exposes the 3 cross-arms, each with 2 
insulators where wires are attached.  Here are the names of the components that are used 
to model this power pylon: 

• Pylon (global zone) 
• Arm (horizontal cross-arm at the top of the structure) 
• Insulator (ceramic insulator string attached at the end of each arm) 

These 3 names are used to create CDB Zones as explained in section 6.5 of the CDB Best 
Practice: Volume 6 OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using OpenFlight.  Here is the 
first level of the resulting graph. 

Pylon

Object Arm[1] Arm[2] Arm[3]
 

The rounded rectangle named Object is an OpenFlight object node containing the 
geometry of the concrete base and lattice steel structure of the pylon, but excluding the 
geometry of the cross-arms.  Arm[1] is the lowest cross-arm; Arm[2] is the middle one; 
Arm[3] is the top one.  Each arm is then made of a steel structure and 2 insulators. 



11 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Arm[n]

Object Insulator[1] Insulator[2]
 

Again, Object represents the steel structure of the cross-arm without the insulators.  
When looking at one of the cross-arm of the power pylon from the back, Insulator[1] is to 
the left while Insulator[2] is to the right.  Finally, each insulator has an attach point to 
indicate where to connect an eventual wire. 

Insulator[n]

Object Attach_Point
 

The node Object contains the geometry of the insulator. 
As explained in section 6.8 of the CDB Best Practice Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for 
Encoding Data using OpenFlight, the resulting list of paths is as follow: 

• \Pylon 
• \Pylon\Arm[1] 
• \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[1] 
• \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
• \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[2] 
• \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 
• \Pylon\Arm[2] 
• \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[1] 
• \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
• \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[2] 
• \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 
• \Pylon\Arm[3] 
• \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[1] 
• \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
• \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[2] 
• \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 

Note the presence of a total of 6 attach points (1 attach point per insulator × 2 insulators 
per cross-arm × 3 cross-arms per pylon = 6 attach points per pylon).  Even though all 
attach points have the same name, there is a unique path to reach each one.  For this 
reason, there is no ambiguity identifying and locating each point. 

6.1.3 Attach Point Orientation 
When creating the attach point of the insulator, pay attention to its orientation.  Since the 
cable attaches underneath the insulator, the Z-axis of the local coordinate system (LCS) 
must be pointing down.  To achieve a proper positioning of the attach point, the modeler 
usually inserts two transformations in the node, one translation and one rotation.  The 
translation positions the point underneath the insulator while the rotation changes the 



12 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

orientation of the Z-axis.  Make sure to leave the Y-axis in the direction of the wire as in 
the figure below. 

 

 
Figure 6-3: Attach Point Orientation 

 

In this figure, the position and orientation of the attach point is identified by the blue-red-
green axis system beneath the insulator.  The Y-axis is in red and points in the same 
direction as the model’s Y-axis, which is toward the front of the model.  The Z-axis is in 
green and points down indicating that wires attach under the insulator. 

6.2 Guideline: Generating Wires between Pylons of a Powerline 
Formerly Annex A.2 in the CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

This guideline is intended for both modelers and developers responsible for the creation 
of: 

• CDB content such as 3D models representing pylons 
• Tools used to generate the Powerline Network datasets 
• Client-devices that use the Powerline Network datasets to generate pylons and 

wires along the transmission line. 



13 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

6.2.1 Powerline Network Attributes 
The table below is the collection of class and instance-level attributes from tables 5-46 
and 5-47 of Volume 1: OGC CDB standard2. 

 

 
Table 6-1: Powerline Attributes 

 

Required

DIR BBH 

EJID BBL 

FACC BBW 

FSC BSR 

JID HGT 

LENL MODL 

RTAI MODT 

SJID SCALn 

WGP  

 

The occurrence of some of the optional attributes depends on the occurrence of other 
optional attributes.  In particular, when MODL is present, other attributes become 
required while others remain optional.  The table below provides the relation between 
MODL and other attributes. 

Table 6-2: MODL-related Attributes 

 

Required Optional 

BSR AO1 

HGT BBH, BBL, BBW 

MODT SCALn 

As a result of the above tables, a CDB-compliant Powerline Network dataset requires 11 
mandatory attributes (listed in the first column of Table 6-1).  Optionally, when a 3D 
model representing a pylon is provided, 4 additional attributes are required (MODL

14

obviously, plus BSR, HGT, and MODT) and 5 others remain optional (AO1, BBH, BBL, 
BBW, and SCALn). 

6.2.2 Generation of HGT 
The HGT attribute represents a special case because table 5-47 suggests that the attribute 
is optional while, in fact, it should always be present.  If you carefully read its description 
in paragraph 5.3.1.2.3.17, you realize that HGT is required in both the line and figure 
point features of the Powerline Network. 
For line features, HGT represents the average height above ground of the powerline when 
no MODL is specified, as suggested by the discussion about HGT in section 5.3.1.17 of 
the CDB Standard Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Data Store 
Structure In the figure point features, HGT represents the height above ground of the 
pylon, whether or not a MODL is provided.  In either file, when MODL is supplied, HGT 
represents the height of the 3D model above the ground. 
You should read guideline (6.3 – old Annex 6.3) for a complete discussion about HGT 

 

6.2.3 Pylon Orientation 
If the orientation of the pylon is specified by AO1, then use the value as-is.  If the 
orientation is not specified, the client device must compute its value using the orientation 
of the segments of the line that are adjacent to the pylon.  In the case of the first and last 
segments, the orientation of the segment is also the orientation of the pylon.  For the other 
segments, the orientation of the pylon is the average of the orientation of the two adjacent 
segments. 

 

6.2.4 Number of Wires 
When no MODL is provided at all – meaning no MODL for the line and none for the 
figure points – and because there is no attribute specifying the number of wires along the 
transmission line, the client device must assume a generic powerline with two wires 
separated by a width of WGP meters connecting generic posts (simple pylons) of HGT 
meters high. 
When a common MODL is specified for the whole line and no figure points are provided, 
it is possible to determine the number of wires by counting the number of attach points in 
the 3D model.  Refer to guideline 6.1.2 (old 6.1.2) for details on how to detect attach 
points. 
If specific MODLs are defined through figure points, the number of attach points in each 
3D model of the collection of all MODLs referenced by the powerline network must be 
identical.  For instance, if the line refers to a generic pylon supporting 4 wires, then all 
specific pylons referenced as figure points must also support 4 wires.  Furthermore, the 
general configuration of all pylons must be identical.  If the general pylon supports 6 
wires configured as a matrix of 2 wires horizontally by 3 wires vertically, then all specific 
pylons must also share the same configuration. 



15 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

6.2.5 How to Connect Wires to Attach Points 
If the client device has a single generic pylon along the line, then there is no problem 
connecting wires and attach points.  That is when multiple pylons are used along the 
same line that problems arise.  The client has to match attach points from one type of 
pylon to attach points on another pylon that may be of a different type.  The algorithm to 
determine how to connect pylons of different types is left to the client device. A future 
version of CDB Standard will provide a robust and deterministic approach on how to 
connect the wires. 

6.3 Guideline: How to Interpret the AHGT, HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z Attributes 
Formerly Annex A.3 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

The goal of this guideline is to promote a correct use of five CDB attributes: AHGT, 
HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z. The article is aimed to both developers and users of content 
creation tools as well as developers of client applications. 

A picture being worth a thousand words, the following diagram should help understand 
the relations between the AHGT, HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z attributes. 

 
Here is a reminder of what these attributes are.  The complete definitions can be found in 
Section 5.3.1.3, CDB Attributes in the CDB Standard Volume 1: OGC CDB Core 
Standard: Model and Physical Data Store Structure. 

• AHGT (Absolute Height) is a flag to interpret correctly the value of 
the Z coordinate of a feature.  When false, the value of Z is relative to 
the ground (Zr); when true, Z is the absolute altitude (Za). 

• AHGT is not related with HGT even though their names are similar. 
• HGT (Height Above Surface Level) is the distance from the top of the 

model to the ground. 
• BBH (Bounding Box Height) is the distance from the top of the model 

to its XY plane. 
• BSR (Bounding Sphere Radius) encompasses the portion of the model 

that is above its XY plane. 
• Z is the altitude of a feature, either absolute or relative to the ground. 

In the diagram above, a model (MODL) is positioned above the ground.  This is indicated 
by the fact that the model’s XY plane does not lie directly on the ground.  The distance

above the ground is represented by Zr.  The diagram clearly shows the relation between 
HGT, BBH, and Zr. 

𝐻𝐺𝑇 = 𝐵𝐵𝐻 + 𝑍𝑟 
When the value of Zr is not readily available from the instance of the feature itself 
(because AHGT is true), it can be computed using the ground height (Gh). 

𝑍𝑟 = 𝑍𝑎 − 𝐺ℎ 
The BBH attribute is optional and defaults to twice the value of BSR, which is mandatory 
for a MODL model. 

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝐵𝐵𝐻 = 2×𝐵𝑆𝑅 

𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝐵𝐵𝐻 ≥ 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 𝐵𝐵𝐻 
 

6.3.1 Typical Use-case 
Typically, a model is positioned relative to the ground without any offset.  As a result, 
AHGT is false, and Zr is set to zero.  Hence… 

𝐻𝐺𝑇 = 𝐵𝐵𝐻 

6.3.2 Light Points 
In the case of airport and environmental light points, no model of a light fixture is 
provided (the MODL attribute is not allowed).  Hence… 

𝐵𝑆𝑅 = 0 → 𝐵𝐵𝐻 = 0 
Currently, the light point datasets do not allow the HGT attribute, the client application 
may have to compute its value using the equation given previously… 

𝐻𝐺𝑇 = 𝐵𝐵𝐻 + 𝑍𝑟 
where BBH is null.  

𝐻𝐺𝑇 = 𝑍𝑟 
And if the light point is positioned at an absolute height (AHGT is true), then… 

𝐻𝐺𝑇 = 𝑍𝑎 − 𝐺ℎ 
 

6.3.3 Recommendation 
Refrain from using AHGT.  There are several advantages to leave this flag to false.  
First, it facilitates the creation of CDB datasets that are independent of each other.  When 
the Z coordinate (altitude) of a feature is relative to the ground, the elevation dataset can 
be updated without the need to re-compute and update all features that have an absolute 
altitude. 
Second, when a feature has an absolute altitude, it is possible that it will end up being 
displayed below the ground by a given client.  How is this possible?  Isn’t it an error in

the data store itself?  No, this is not an error.  It is perfectly possible to create content that 
is valid and – still – produce an incorrect result at the client level.  Consider a feature that 
is positioned with an absolute height in a valley between two mountains of a high 
resolution terrain profile.  At coarse LOD of terrain elevation, the valley and the 
mountains may (and will) be flattened producing a terrain skin that may no longer pass 
underneath the feature.  Now imagine a client that uses that coarse LOD of elevation to 
create a terrain skin and then draw the feature at its absolute altitude, which happen to be 
underneath the terrain skin.  The feature will not be visible or will be partially occluded 
by the terrain. 
These reasons explain why the use of the AHGT flag should be avoided whenever 
possible. 

 

6.3.4 When should AHGT be used? 
Limit the use of AHGT to data whose source is inherently absolute.  Such source data 
include geodetic marks or survey marks that provide a known position in terms of 
latitude, longitude, and altitude.  Good examples of such markers are boundary markers 
between countries.h 

6.4 Guideline: How to Model a Wind Turbine 
Formerly Annex A.4 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

This text proposes a way to create a 3D model representing an articulated wind turbine.  
The articulations of interest are the yaw control to orient the turbine in the direction of the 
wind, the roll control to allow rotation of the rotor, and, optionally, the pitch control to 
change the orientation of the blades, if needed. 

Beside is a typical Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine.  The components 
of interest are the following: 

• Turbine 
• Rotor 
• Blade 

Looking at appendix F – CDB 
Model Components – we note that 
Turbine is not listed and, 
consequently, will be proposed for 
addition to future version of the 
CDB standard. 

The CDB metadata folder provides the proper 
code for a Wind Turbine, AD010-0053.  The 

                                                
3 As of CDB Specification 3.2, the CDB FDD is no longer provided in the documents to avoid the risk of 
miscorrelation between the appendix and the metadata.  The FDD is now exclusively found in the Metadata 
folder.

code indicates the presence of a man-made point feature. 
A = Culture 
D = Power Generator 
010 = Power Plant 
005 = Wind 

The hierarchy graph of the OpenFlight model could look like the one on the right.  If 
individual control of the pitch of each blade is required, the Blades object (the lower right 
node) could be replaced with three (3) sub-trees each containing a Blade zone, a DOF 
node, and an object node. 
With the proposed layout, a client device will detect the presence of a wind turbine 
through its feature attribute code (aka feature code), and recognize and control two 
articulations, the Turbine Yaw angle, and Rotor Roll angle. 

A last note: to comply with the prescribed orientation of the CDB coordinate system as 
defined in section 6.3 Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using OpenFlight, 
the rotor must represent the front of the wind turbine (and not its right side).

6.5 Guideline: Handling of Model Interiors 
Formerly Annex A.5 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

CDB introduces the concept of the interior of a 3D model.  The concept is developed in 
section 6.18, Model Interior, of the CDB Standard Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for 
Encoding Data using OpenFlight.  The following text serves as a complement to the 
standard to understand how the concept has been developed and how model interior is 
intended to be used. 

6.5.1 Relationship between Model Shell and Model Interior 
The ModelInteriorGeometry dataset is a subordinate dataset of the ‘regular’ 
ModelGeometry dataset.  It depends directly on it.  This is best illustrated by an example.

10 Finest Shell Finest Interior 
11 - - 
12 - - 
13 - - 
14 - - 
15 - - 
… - - 

 
In the above table, the Shell column represents what is called the ‘regular’ 
ModelGeometry dataset.  In this example, the model appears at LOD 2, a better version 
exists at LOD 6, an even better at LOD 8, and finally, the most detailed shell is at LOD 
10.  The Interior column shows 3 different LODs of interiors.  There cannot be more 
Interior LODs than Shell LODs.  Also, once an interior is provided (here at LOD 6), it 
must be provided for all subsequent (finer) LODs of the shell (LOD 8 and 10).  Which 
means… interior at LOD 8 and 10 must exist. 

6.5.2 Detecting Presence of a Model Interior 
It is expected that a client will first request the shell of the model, then discover that the 
model has an interior because of the presence of a CDB Zone whose name is Interior (see 
6.18.2 Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using OpenFlight, Pseudo-
Interior), and then decide if the pseudo interior is sufficient for the application or if the 
real interior is necessary. 

6.5.3 Access of a Model Interior 
Client applications that are interested in 3D models will typically perform the following 
sequence of actions: 

1. Load the GS Features of a tile 
2. Load the GS and GT Models referenced by the GS Features 
3. For each model, traverse its graph and detect the presence of an 

optional Interior (Zone name = Interior) 
4. Decide to load the corresponding Interior (or not) 

Interior datasets exists for both geospecific and geotypical models; hence, all features can 
be represented by a 3D model and all 3D models can have a separately modeled interior.  
Note the symmetry between the file names of shell and interior datasets.  For geospecific 
models, the names of geometry files are… 

• GeoCell_D300_S001_T001_Lxx_Ux_Rx_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.flt 
• GeoCell_D305_S001_T001_Lxx_Ux_Rx_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.flt 

For geotypical models, the file names become… 
• D510_S001_T001_Lxx_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.flt 
• D515_S001_T001_Lxx_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.flt 

Note that in both cases, the only difference between the name of the shell and the name of 
the corresponding interior is the dataset code; and in both cases, a value of 5 is added to 
the ‘regular’ ModelGeometry dataset code.

6.5.4 UHRB vs CDB Object Models 
To help understand how CDB Model Interior maps to UHRB concepts, three (3) 
diagrams are provided below.  The first two diagrams illustrate the UHRB Object Model4 
while the third diagram presents the corresponding CDB Object Model. 

The first diagram is the UHRB Class Diagram presented in Figure 6-4 below.  The class 
diagram presents twelve classes of which eight are concrete classes that can be used to 
represent tangible objects.  The UHRB_EDM_COMPLEX_FEATURE class implements 
an extension mechanism that is not required in the context of the CDB Specification.  The 
remaining seven UHRB classes will be mapped to CDB zones. 

 
Figure 6-4: UHRB Class Diagram 

 
The second diagram is the UHRB Association Diagram of Figure 6-5; it shows all 
permissible associations between the UHRB classes.

6.6 Guideline: Applying Constraints to Uniformly Gridded Terrain 
Formerly Annex A.6 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

The following sub-sections describe the handling of point, linear and polygon (polygon) 
constraint features into a Uniformly Gridded Terrain Elevation dataset (e.g. terrain x,y 
offset datasets are not available) 



23 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Note that the rendering outcome into the Elevation dataset may vary depending on the 
rendering order of overlapping points, lines or polygons (polygons).  In order to achieve 
deterministic outcome by all types of client-devices, client-devices are required to sort 
features by their layer priority number LPN before using them to constrain the terrain 
elevation dataset.  

The rendering of a point, a linear or polygon (polygon) features into the Uniformly 
Sampled Terrain Elevation dataset is performed into the same LOD as the LOD in which 
the vector feature appeared. 	

6.6.1 Constraint Points 

This section describes the required client-device behavior for PointZ and MultiPointZ 
features used as terrain elevation constraint points (AHGT is true) into a uniformly 
sampled terrain elevation dataset. 

The application of a constraint point P is very much like drawing an anti-aliased rectangle 
centered on P into the uniform terrain elevation grid.   The rectangle shape is defined by 
feature attributes BBL, BBH and AO1. Consider a terrain grid element A in the 
immediate vicinity of a constraint point P. After applying the constraint P to terrain grid 
element A, the new elevation 𝐸! is:		

𝐸!  =  𝐸! ∗ 𝐴𝑖𝑛!" +  𝐸! ∗  𝐴𝑜𝑢𝑡!" 	

where… 

𝐸!	is	elevation	of	grid	element	A	

𝐸!	is	elevation	of	constraint	point	P	

𝐴𝑖𝑛!"	 is	 the	 percentage	 overlap	 of	 constraint	 point	 P	 onto	 grid

6.6.2 Constraint Linear Features 

This section describes the required client-device behavior for PolyLineZ features used as 
terrain elevation constraint linear feature (AHGT is true) into a uniformly sampled terrain 
elevation dataset. 

First, the PolyLineZ feature is broken into a series of constraint lines. The application of 
each constraint line L is very much like drawing an anti-aliased line centered on L into 
the uniform terrain elevation grid.   The width of the line is defined by feature attribute 
WGP.  Consider a terrain grid element A in the immediate vicinity of a constraint line L, 
defined by vertices V1 and V2. After applying the constraint line L to terrain grid 
element A, the new elevation 𝐸! is:  

𝐸!  =  𝐸!" ∗ 𝐴𝑖𝑛!" +  𝐸! ∗  𝐴𝑜𝑢𝑡!" 	

where… 

𝐸!	is	elevation	of	grid	element	A

6.6.3 Constraint Polygons 

This section describes the required client-device behavior of PolygonZ and MultiPatch 
features used as terrain elevation constraint points (AHGT is true) into a uniformly 
sampled terrain elevation dataset. 

Each vector PolygonZ feature consists of a 
number of rings (or parts).  Each ring is a closed 
(the first vertex is same as the last vertex), non-
self-intersecting loop.  A PolygonZ feature may 
contain multiple outer rings.  A sequence of rings 
can describe a convex or concave feature outline.    
In the CDB standard, rings can only be made up 
of triangles.

Each vector MultiPatch feature consists of a number of rings (or parts).  Each ring is a 
closed (the first vertex is same as the last vertex), non-self-intersecting loop.  A sequence 
of rings can describe a convex or concave feature outline. While the vector MultiPatch 
feature permits multiple inner rings (aka parts), this capability is dis-allowed in CDB.  
Furthermore, rings can only be made up of triangles.  

The rendering of the vector feature is handled as a series of constraint triangles applied in 
the order in which they appear within the vector PolygonZ record.  The application of 
each constraint triangle T is very much like drawing an anti-aliased triangle into the 
uniform terrain elevation grid.   Consider a terrain grid element A in the immediate 
vicinity of a constraint triangle T, defined by vertices V1, V2 and V3. After applying the 
constraint triangle T to terrain grid element A, the new elevation 𝐸! is:  

𝐸!  =  𝐸!" ∗ 𝐴𝑖𝑛!" +  𝐸! ∗  𝐴𝑜𝑢𝑡!" 	

where… 

𝐸!	is	elevation	of	grid	element	A

6.7 Guideline: Applying Constraints to Non-Uniform Gridded Terrain (A.7) 

Formerly Annex A.7 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

The following sub-sections describe the rendering of point, line and polygon (polygons) 
into a Non-Uniformly Gridded Terrain Elevation dataset described in addendum “CDB 
Standard Addendum – Non-Uniform Sampled Terrain Elevation” 

Note that the rendering outcome into the Elevation dataset may vary depending on the 
rendering order of overlapping points, lines or polygons.  The Layer Priority Number 
(LPN) attribute is used to achieve deterministic outcome by all types of client-devices.  
When ECP is supplied, client-devices are required to sort overlapping constraint points, 
lines and polygons in low-to-high order and then render them in that order.   Value of 
LPN can range from 0-32767.   

The rendering of a point, a line or polygon features into the Non-uniformly Sampled 
Terrain Elevation dataset is performed into the same LOD as the LOD in which the 
vector feature appeared.

6.7.1 Constraint Points 

This section describes the required client-device behavior for PointZ and MultiPointZ 
features used as terrain elevation constraint points (AHGT is true) into a non-uniformly 
sampled terrain elevation dataset.  

The application of a constraint point P is applied as follows: 
1. The x,y address of the affected terrain grid element is computed by 

truncating the lat-long coordinates of point P; note that the truncation 
operation varies in accordance to LOD of the terrain; however, it always 
yields grid element addresses in the range of 0-1023. 

2. The x,y offset of the affected terrain grid element is computed by 
performing a MOD of  the lat-long coordinates of point P in accordance to 
its LOD.

6.8 Guideline: LOD Read Behavior of Subordinate Datasets (A.8) 
Formerly Annex A.8 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

In the CDB Standard, LOD read behavior of subordinated datasets was mentioned only 
briefly in… 

• Section 5.2.1.2.3 Subordinate Terrain Elevation Components (Volume 1: OGC 
CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure) which stated “The 
CDB standard does not permit the use of subordinate Terrain Elevation 
component when the primary Terrain Elevation component is not generated.” 

• Section 5.2.1.3.4 Default Read Value: which stated “Simulator client-devices 
should assume … if the data values are not available (files associated with the 
Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed). 

• Section 5.2.1.6 Subordinate Bathymetry Component: which stated “Furthermore, 
since the Bathymetry values are relative to Terrain Elevation component, each 
value in the Bathymetry component must be matched to the finest available LOD 
elevation values of the Terrain Elevation component”.

Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed). 

• Section 5.2.2.3.2 Default Read Value: which stated “Simulator client-devices 
should assume … if the data values are not available (files associated with the 
Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed). 

 

This guideline provides clarification on the client-device LOD read behavior of 
subordinated datasets; it describes the mandated behavior of a simulator client-device 
when reading a LOD of a Primary Elevation Component and combining it with another 
LOD of a Subordinate Terrain Elevation Component 

Consider the case where a simulator client-device is attempting to read CDB data for a 
given region of the CDB at LOD = p.  The CDB region has a Primary Elevation 
Component populated with data ranging from LOD = -10 to LOD = m, and a Subordinate 
Elevation Component populated with data ranging from LOD = -10 to LOD = n. 

The required client-device read behavior is illustrated in Figure 6-12 below, and can be 
summarized as follows: 

• For -10 ≤ p ≤ m, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at 
LOD = p. 

• For p > m ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at 
LOD = m. 

• For -10 ≤ p ≤ n, the client-device accesses the subordinate elevation data 
at LOD = p. 

• For p > n ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at 
LOD = n. 

• For p > m and p < n and m < n, the client-device interpolates the primary 
elevation data from LOD = m to LOD = p before combining it with the 
subordinate elevation data of LOD = p. 

• For p > m and p > n and m < n, the client-device interpolates the primary 
elevation data from LOD = m to LOD = n before combining it with the 
subordinate elevation data of LOD = n. 

• For p < m and p > n and m > n, the client-device interpolates the 
subordinate elevation data from LOD = n to LOD = p before combining it 
with the primary elevation data of LOD = p. 

• For p > m and p > n and m > n, the client-device interpolates the 
subordinate elevation data from LOD = n to LOD = m before combining it 
with the primary elevation data of LOD = m. 



34 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

• For n = φ (unavailable) and p > m ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the 
default value in Defaults.xml for the subordinate elevation data. 

• The combination of (m = φ (unavailable) and n ≥ -10), is not permitted, 
i.e., the generation of Subordinate Terrain Elevation LODs is not 
permitted if the Primary Terrain Elevation component have not been 
generated. 

• If the default value for the Primary Elevation dataset is unavailable in 
Defaults.xml, or if Defaults.xml file is missing, then the client-device must 
revert to the client-device’s internal default value for this dataset. 

• If the default value for the Subordinate Elevation dataset is unavailable in 
Defaults.xml, or if Defaults.xml file is missing, then the client-device must 
revert to the client-device’s internal default value for this dataset. 

 

 
Figure 6-12: Client-device Read Behavior 

 
The default value for the Primary Terrain Elevation component is the constant 
Primary_Elevation, which can be found in \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml.  The CDB 
standard recommends that the value for Primary_Elevation = 0.  In the case where the 
default value cannot be found within the Defaults.xml file, or that the Defaults.xml file 
cannot be found, the CDB standard recommends that client-devices internally generate a 
default value of Primary_Elevation = 0. 



35 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The default values for the Subordinate Terrain Elevation layer “n” (where “n” is the 
subordinate elevation layer number, e.g., a value from 2 to 99) is the constant 
Subordinate_Elevation-n, which can be found in \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml.  The 
CDB standard recommends that the value for Subordinate_Elevation-n = 0.  In the case 
where the default value cannot be found within the Defaults.xml file, or that the 
Defaults.xml file cannot be found, the CDB standard recommends that client-devices 
internally generate a default value of Subordinate_Elevation-n = 0. 
 
The CDB standard does not permit the use of Subordinate Terrain Elevation components 
when the Primary Terrain Elevation component is not generated. 

6.9 Information: Tide Simulation Modeling Alternatives (Was A15) 
Formerly Annex A.15 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

The availability of a Tide component permits realistic simulation of tides with a minimal 
computational overhead by the simulation application.  Furthermore, the Tide component 
also permits simulation of tides whose amplitude varies differently with location.  In 
order to determine the shoreline profile at a given location, the simulator client-devices 
must first determine the height of (say) the ocean in the immediate vicinity of that 
location.  The sophistication of this calculation can vary greatly with simulation fidelity. 

Figure 6-13: Examples of Ocean Tide Simulation Fidelity in Simulator, illustrates 
examples of how tide simulation might be handled.  At the low-end of the fidelity 
spectrum, the tide level (expressed as a value between –100% (average low tide) and 
100% (average high tide) could be provided directly at the simulator’s control console.  
In a high-end simulation, one could develop a simulation of the earth’s oceans that takes 
into account Bathymetry profile of the oceans and the ephemeris model (particularly 
moon and sun) as a function of time and date.  Regardless of simulation fidelity, the CDB 
internal representation facilitates the work of simulation client devices that are interested 
in obtaining the shoreline profile and ocean heights.

6.10 CDB and FalconView (Was A.16) 
Formerly Annex A.16 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

While the CDB file naming convention and its directory structure are somewhat different 
from that used in FalconView5, it is possible to find equivalent files between the two. 

The FalconView directory structure contains some metadata describing its content and 
area coverage; it has a three level directory structure.  The first level “rpf” is a raster 
product format: the second level being the dataset such as “gnc” (global navigation 
chart): and the third level relates to the zones; all files are under the third level.  The file 
name is eight characters long followed by a three-character file extension, and the file 
name portion uses a radix 34 numbering notation that is based on the position of the 
frame in the zone as well as revision info and the producer ID key.  The file extension is 
based on the dataset and the zone.  Note that frames are equivalent to CDB tiles. 

From information such as a given lat/lon, a given resolution such as one-meter pixel size 
and the dataset such as global navigation chart, it is possible to generate the 
corresponding FalconView file name and its path.  Similarly, given a lat/lon, an LOD and 
a dataset it is possible to generate a CDB file name and its path.  Though not identical in 
coverage and resolution these two files should be similar in content for the same dataset. 
                                                
5 FalconView® is a multi-platform mapping and mission planning application developed by the  Georgia 
Tech Research Institute for the United States Department of Defense. With a 20-year history of active 
development the software has become a de facto standard within the US DoD and is also used by various 
Federal Agencies and Allied Countries. https://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView

Note that when given a CDB file name, it is possible to extract the tile position in lat/lon, 
the dataset it belongs to, and the LOD, even its full path name, i.e. the file name is unique 
for the entire CDB.  This is not the case for FalconView.  Since the resolution is not 
implicit in the name, the file itself must be read to extract this information; the dataset 
and zone info can be extracted from the file extension.  Also note that directories in 
FalconView can potentially be very large since all files in a zone reside in the same 
directory; this is especially true for fine resolutions. 
The FalconView directory structure follows the guidelines and conventions specified by 
MIL-STD-2411. 
The algorithms used to find file name are given by examples within the MIL-C-89041 
Controlled Image Base (CIB) document; in that document, zones are shown as 
overlapping.  Note that this may not reflect the manner in which FalconView was 
implemented; nonetheless this does not affect the methodology provided in this section. 

6.10.1 FalconView Directory structure 
In FalconView, a top-level directory contains files that are metadata containing 
information about the various datasets and files in the directories.   

The FalconView directory structure is as follows:

6.10.2 FalconView Zones definition 
MIL-STD-2411 divides the world into 18 zones, nine in the northern hemisphere and 
nine in the southern hemisphere.  The first eight zones in both hemispheres are divided 
into frames, which in turn are divided into sub-frames.  Frames are made of pixels with 
1536 x 1536 pixels in a frame; there are 36, 6x6 sub-frames per frame.  Between each 
zone, there is an overlap of one frame; this implies that the size of zones will vary slightly 
depending on the resolution that is used.  Table 6-3 Zones Range No Overlap  gives the 
approximate range of each zones; 1 – 9 in the north, A - J in the south.  The two extreme 
zones, which cover the north and south poles, use a different scheme and are not 
discussed here.

6.10.3 FalconView Zone resolution 
Along lines of constant longitude, the pixel constant used to determine the size of frames 
is a function of the resolution but is independent of the zone.  Along lines of constant 
latitude the constant is a function of both resolution and zone and is based on the mid 
latitude of the zone.  Table 6-4 Example Resolution east-west pixel constants that is 
extracted from MIL-C-89041 enumerates the factors for three resolutions.

The north-south or latitudinal pixel constant is the number of pixels from the 
equator to the pole (90°).  The east-west pixel constant is the number of pixels 
longitudinally from the 180° west longitude meridian going 360° in an 
easterly direction along the zone midpoint. 

6.10.4 FalconView Zone extension based on resolution 
To illustrate, we will use as an example a resolution of 10 meters. To calculate the exact 
latitudinal zone extent for a given resolution, first calculate the number of pixels in a

divided by 1536, the number of pixels rows in a frame, and rounded up to the nearest

The number of longitudinal frames and subframes is computed by determining the 
number of subframes to reach around the earth along a parallel at the zone midpoint.  The 
east-west pixel constant is divided by 256 pixels to determine the number of subframes.  
The results are divided by 6 and rounded up to obtain the number of frame columns.

6.10.5 FalconView Frame Position 
MIL-C-89041 states that “the origin for counting nonpolar frame rows and columns is the 
southernmost latitude of the zone and 180° west longitude, with columns counted in an 
easterly direction from that origin, as opposed to frames and subframes where “the origin 
for the subframe and pixel numbering within frames and subframes shall be from the 
upper left corner”. 
For a given latitude φ  and longitude λ the row and column for the frame where that 
geographic position is situated can be computed.  The determination of the zone is 
derived from the latitude except at the border of zones where an overlap exists and the 
zone must be picked.

6.10.6 FalconView File Naming Convention 
MIL-C-89041 for Controlled Image Base (CIB) states that: 

“The naming convention for all resolutions of images registered in MIL-STD-
2411-1, where it is intended for producers to provide contiguous [frame file] 
coverage, shall conform to MIL-STD-2411.  In addition, the CIB [frame file] 
names are further restricted to conform to the form “ffffffvp.ccz.”  The “ffffff” 
portion of the name shall be a radix 34 value that encodes the unique cumulative 
frame number within a zone in base 34, with the right-most digit being the least 
significant position. The radix 34 value incorporates the numbers 0 through 9 and 
letters A through Z exclusive of the letters “I” and “O” as they are easily 
confused with the numbers “1” and “0”.  For example, the “ffffff” portion of 
the names would start with “000000,” proceed through “000009,” “00000Z,” 
“000010,” and so forth until “ZZZZZZ.”  This allows 1,544,804,416 unique 
[frame file] names; a contiguous grid of frame names down to a resolution of 0.2 
meters (approximately 8 inches) can be defined.  The “v” portion of the name 
shall be a radix 34 value that encodes the successive version number.  The “p” 
portion of the name shall be a radix 34 value that designates the producer code ID, 
as defined in MIL-STD-2411-1.  The “cc” and “z” portions of the name 
extension shall encode the data series code and the zone, respectively, as defined 
in MIL-STD-2411-1.  The CIB producers are responsible to ensure that [frame 
files] for all image resolutions, zones, and revisions, have unique names.” 

In our case:    ffffff crzRC NFF ×+=  

  … rzNczt  resolutiona for   zone in columns ofnumber   theis  where  

 
In the example of a lat of 36 and lon –88 with a resolution of 10 meters we get: 

 
ffffff = 503+29x1970=57633 or 001FV3(34) 
 

… where 1970 is number columns in zone 2 as given in Table 6-5 Frame/Subframe Sizes for 
Source Image GSD of 10 Meters, and in RADIX 34 we get ffffff = 001FV3 ; for a global 



43

navigation chart dataset a version level 0, a manufacturer code of 3 and zone 2 the file 
name would be equal to “001FV303.GN2” 

Note that nothing in the file name defines the resolution for the data; this information is 
part of the [coverage section] in the file itself (see section 3.12.3 in MIL-C-89041).  Also 
note that the file name is unique only to the zone at a given resolution. 
On the other hand a similar file for imagery (VSTI, Visible Spectrum Terrain Imagery) in 
the CDB convention for an LOD of 04 which has a resolution of approximately 8 meters; 
at position lat 36 and lon –88 we would get for the file name: 

 
\CDB\Tiles\N36\W088\004_Imagery\L04\U0\	

N36W088_D004_S001_T001_L04_U0_R0.jp2	
	

Note that the file name itself is unique worldwide and that from it we can derive the 
directory path to which it belongs. 

6.11 Managing CDB Data Store Versions (Was A.18) 
Formerly Annex A.18 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

The incremental versioning mechanism of a CDB data store provides a fast method of 
creating versions of the CDB data store changes since all the data changes are located 
under a single root directory.  The creation and the managing of the (incremental) data 
files are however under the application control. 

A CDB data store can simultaneously hold multiple incremental versions of the data.  As 
a result, it is possible to select any of the versions without transferring or copying files.  
Consider the case where a data store generation facility, a data store quality assurance 
facility, a simulator mission planning facility, a mission rehearsal facility and a mission 
debrief are all operating concurrently on distinct versions of the CDB.  This is illustrated 
in Figure 3 2: Concurrent Usage of Versions of the CDB data store.  By the fourth day, 
there are four versions of the CDB data store, say the active default CDB (v1) and three 
incremental versions (v2, v3, v4).  Any of these four versions can be instantly invoked 
(without copying or transferring files) by the simulator operator at the Mission Rehearsal 
facility, or by an instructor at the Mission Debrief facility.

Figure 6-14: Concurrent Usage of CDB Versions 

 
The underlying CDB versioning mechanism is a fine-grained file-level mechanism, i.e., 
only the affected files of the geographic areas of the CDB data store need to be versioned, 
leaving the rest of the CDB data store intact.  This approach is invaluable in mission 
rehearsal applications where the target areas of the CDB data store require frequent 
updates based on the latest intelligence data. 

The approach can also be applied to the handling of classified secure data.  In this case, a 
CDB version can be used to hold the portion of the CDB data store that contains the 
classified information.  The incremental versioning mechanism would be used to 
segregate the classified portion of the CDB data store onto a separate storage medium.  
Since the classified portion of the CDB data store is embedded within the overall CDB 
structure, it is possible for the runtime publishers to instantly switch back and forth 
between the classified and non-classified versions of the data store. 
 

6.12 Guideline: Handling of GS and T2D Models (Was A.19) 
Formerly Annex A.19 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

6.12.1 GSModels 

6.12.1.1 GSModel Levels-of-detail 
The insertion of a 3DModel-LOD into the LOD hierarchy of the GSModel Dataset is 
solely dependent on its Location, its Significant Size and on its Storage Size. 
The location and Significant Size of a 3DModel-LOD determines where it is nominally 
inserted into the GSModel Dataset hierarchy.  This approach ensures that the modeled 
content is organized in files that contain co-located objects of similar size.  This approach 
provides client-device with an optimal means of accessing and filtering modeled content 
(by location and by size). 



45 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
 

Figure 6-15: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows in GSModel Dataset 

 
3DModel-LODs are accumulated into the Tile-LODs of the GSModel hierarchy.  The 
size of these Tile-LODs is capped to GSModelFileSize.  In the event that a group of 
3DModel-LODs nominally assigned to a Tile-LOD causes this limit to be exceeded, the 
3DModel-LODs that are deemed to have the lowest contribution to the Tile-LOD are 
moved to finer (children) Tile-LODs until the Tile-LOD is once again within its size limit 
(illustrated in Figure 6-15: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows in GSModel Dataset).  In the 
event that a 3DModel-LOD is itself larger than GSModelFileSize, the 3DModel-LOD is 
moved to the 4 finer Tile-LODs of the GSModel Dataset hierarchy. This approach 



46 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

ensures that the modeled content is accessible in chunks that are bounded; this improves 
the allocation and management of memory allocation in the client-devices. 

 
 

NOTE:  The Significant Size of a 3DModel-LOD determines where it is 
nominally inserted into the 3DModel LOD hierarchy.  In this nominal 
case, each Tile-LOD of the 3DModel Dataset holds a group of 
3DModels-LODs that have similar Significant Sizes.  This enables the 
client-devices to determine the range at which the 3DModel-LOD can be 
optimally blended-in to the scene (so that the model falls within a 
specified angular error criterion). 

 
The bounding criterion of 3DModel Tiles can lead to LOD migration, thus 

breaking the relationship between the Significant Size of a 3DModel-
LOD and the nominal CDB LOD it belongs to.  As a result, client-devices 
can no longer guarantee the range at which the 3DModel-LOD will be 
blended-in to the scene.  In effect, each time the 3DModel-LOD is 
migrated by one LOD, the client-device will likely shorten the range at 
which it is blended into the scene by a factor of 2X, leading to potentially 
distracting artifacts.  The severity of the artifacts is proportional to the 
amount of content that has migrated to finer LODs and to the number of 
LODs by which the content has moved. 

 
While the CDB standard allows the migration of 3DModel-LODs to finer 

LODs when Tile-LODs overflows are encountered, it is understood that 
this may lead to rendering artifacts that might be considered 
unsatisfactory.  Consequently, it is strongly recommended that tools 
(that generate the CDB hierarchy) be designed to optionally 
disallow the migration of 3DModel-LODs to finer LODs upon 
overflows, and instead flag the overflow condition and then abort.  
Upon such cases, modelers can then re-assess which 3DModels should 
be discarded or remodeled in order to simultaneously satisfy the CDB 
bounding criteria and the application requirements. 

 

 
Each of the 3DModel-LODs is nominally configured as exchange-LODs.  The exchange-
LOD mechanism assumes that client-devices gradually substitute a coarser 3DModel-
LOD located in a coarser Tile-LOD with a finer 3DModel-LOD located in a finer Tile-
LOD. 
While this exchange-LOD mechanism is simple, it can lead to inefficiencies when 
extremely fine features cause the GSModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended by several 
LODs.  Consider the case of a 1 meter road sign located next to a large building (30m 
wide x 30m long x 10 m high).  As we will see in the following section, the road sign 
would nominally be inserted at LOD 9 of the GSModel Dataset hierarchy.  Conversely, 
the large modeled building would nominally be inserted at LOD 4.  The road sign forces 
the GSModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended by 5 additional LODs.

Figure 6-16: Compacting the GSModel Dataset 

 
In order to reduce the depth of the LOD hierarchy, the GSModel Dataset is post-
processed and subjected to a “compaction” process, starting from the finest LOD (e.g. 
LODmax) and progressing to the coarser levels.  The compaction process takes finer 
3DModel-LODs and appends them to the corresponding 3DModels in coarser Tile-LODs 
of the GSModel Dataset.  The appended (finer) 3DModel-LOD must have an explicit 
OpenFlight LOD node with the Significant Size of the 3DModel-LOD; this provides the 
necessary information for the client-device to control the range at which the 3DModel-
LOD will be introduced into the rendered scene.  The process is recursively applied to the 



48 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

coarser LODs until the parent LOD is packed to capacity.  This approach ensures that the 
modeled content is accessible in similarly-sized chunks of processing; this provides the 
means to improve internal parallelism and pipelining (i.e. improves client-device 
determinism) 

The access and selection of 3DModel-LODs is done through the GSFeature Dataset.  
Each of the Tile-LODs of the GSFeature Dataset contains a list of Features; each Feature 
in turn points to a 3DModel-LOD at the appropriate LOD.  In effect, the appearance of a 
Feature (along with its modeled representation) and the evolution of its modeled 
representation are entirely controlled by the GSFeature Dataset.  As a result, the 
3DModel-LODs of a 3DModel need not be located in consecutive LODs of GSModel 
Dataset hierarchy. 

6.12.1.2 CDB LOD versus GSModel Significant Size 
Section 6.8.3 of CDB Standard Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using 
OpenFlight provides a set of guidelines to establish the values for Significant Size SSc 
and SSLOD for GSModels. 
Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution shows the nominal position of a GSModel 
within the LOD hierarchy of the GSModel Dataset.  Note all of the GSModel-LODs of a 
GSModel normally fall within a range of 8 levels-of-detail (i.e. the smallest tile size the 
GSModel can sit on).  However, it is possible to extend this range by breaking up a 
GSModel-LOD into several OpenFlight files. 

Here is a summary of the rules required by the CDB standard in order to ensure 
deterministic operation from client-devices: 

1. Each feature may have multiple modeled representations at progressively 
coarser levels of detail.  Each of the modeled representations is referred to 
as a GSModel-LOD.  In absence of pre-modeled coarser LOD 
representations, the tools may automatically generate coarser modeled 
levels-of-detail. 

2. A GSModel-LOD consists of a group of polygons that represent a feature 
at a specific level-of-detail; this group of polygons shares a unique Model 
Identifier derived from the Feature Attribute Code a Feature Sub-Code 
(FSC), a Model Name (MODL or MMDC), the GSModel-LOD’s 
Significant Size SS’LOD. 

3. Each GSModel has a distinct Significant Size SS’ value based on its 
dimensions.  In turn, each GSModel-LOD of a same GSModel has a 
distinct Significant Size value SS’LOD based on its modeled accuracy. 

4. Insertion of a GSModel-LOD into the GSModel Dataset hierarchy 
proceeds as follows.  Starting with LODmax (LODmax is a variable set by the 
user that sets the maximum depth of the LOD hierarchy) and progressing 
to coarser LODs… 
a. For each Tile-LOD, create a Model_List that is constructed from the 

GSModel-LODs that straddle the Tile-LOD. 
i. If the GSModel-LOD is not the coarsest LOD and its Significant Size 

is in accordance to  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution,

then add it to the Tile-LOD. Only the coarser GSModel-LODs of this 
GSModel are available for future insertion into the GSModel LOD 
hierarchy. 

ii. If the GSModel-LOD is the coarsest LOD of the GSModel and its 
Significant Size is in accordance to  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. 
Model Resolution, then insert it at this LOD of the hierarchy. If the 
GSModel-LOD matches the Tile-LOD, remove it from the list for the 
processing of the coarser Tile-LOD. 

b. If the Model_List is less than GSModelFileSize, no further processing 
is required. 

NOTE: The Storage Size of (statically-positioned) MModels is assumed 
to be zero. 

c. The Model_List of each Tile-LOD is sorted in decreasing order of 
Diff, where Diff is the difference between the Significant Size SS of 
the Model and the Significant Size as specified in Table 2. 

d. If the size of the Model_List is greater than GSModelFileSize, then 
(starting with the first entry in the sorted Model_List), Models are 
simplified one-by-one until the size of the Model_List is less than 
GSModelFileSize.  When a simplification occurs, the Model_List is re-
sorted using the Diff value. 

e. If a) the Model_List is deemed non-reducible and b) the Model_List is 
still greater than GSModelFileSize … 
i. If LOD < LODmax, then… 

(1) a Temp_Model_List is created and initialized with the  contents 
of the Model_list.  Starting from the end of the Model_List, 
Models are removed one-by-one from the Model_list (starting 
with the first Model in the Model_List) and are copied into the 
Temp_Model_List until the Model_List reaches 
GSModelFileSize. 

(2) The Temp_Model_List is merged to the children Tile-LODs and 
the children are re-processed using steps 4a to 4e.  The process 
is iterative, i.e., the “overflow” is propagated into the finer 
LODs of the GSModel hierarchy. 

ii. Else… 
(1)  Models are removed one-by-one, starting with the first Model 

in the Model_List, until the Model_List is less than 
GSModelFileSize.  The corresponding GSModels are removed 
from the CDB and a warning is issued stating that content was 
removed

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that GSModels be modeled using 
several GSModel-LODs, spanning a wide range of fidelity.  The 
availability of many LODs ensures suitability of the resulting CDB for 
real-time use with a minimum degradation in fidelity.  Conversely, a low 
number of LODs can lead to unacceptably large steps in fidelity. 

 

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the coarsest modeled LOD of 
GSModels have no more than 128 vertices; this reduces the likelihood 
that the coarsest modeled LOD need be propagated to a finer LOD of 
the hierarchy. 

 

NOTE: This algorithm preserves the highest available modeled content 
while ensuring that the runtime constraint file size limits are respected.  
While the CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized GSModel-LODs, a 
client-device may refuse to render the GSModel-LOD if it has insufficient 
memory to load all of the OpenFlight files that make-up the GSModel-
LODs. 

 
5. Each GSModel-LOD is subject to an OpenFlight file size limit of 

GSModelFileSize, i.e. several OpenFlight files, each within the 
GSModelFileSize limit, can be used to represent a very complex 
GSModel-LOD. Each of OpenFlight files that form the GSModel-LOD 
share the same GSModel-LOD Identifier (see rule 2) and GSModel-LOD 
origin.  Client-devices must render the GSModel-LOD in its entirety, even 
if it is allocated to several OpenFlight files. 
 

NOTE: While the CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized GSModel-
LODs, a client-device may refuse to render the GSModel-LOD if it has 
insufficient memory to load all of the OpenFlight files that make-up the 
GSModel-LODs. 

 
6. Each Tile-LOD is subject to a file size limit of GSModelFileSize. 
7. All of the GSModel-LODs in a GSModel OpenFlight file are nominally 

exchange-LODs (see exception in next rule). 
8. The depth of the GSModel LOD hierarchy should be reduced by folding-

in the finer GSModel-LOD located in a finer Tile-LOD to the next coarser 
Tile-LOD of the hierarchy.  Failure to perform this “compaction step” may 
result in significantly deeper GSModel LOD hierarchy when the finest 
GSModel-LODs consist of small features or small details on the same 
features (e.g., small posts next to a terminal building or fine window 
details on a large building).

9. The finer modeled representation of a GSModel (i.e. a GSModel-LOD 
with a smaller Significant Size) always appears in finer LODs of the 
GSModel Dataset LOD hierarchy than a coarser GSModel-LOD. 

10. A Tile-LOD cannot contain more than one GSModel-LOD of the same 
GSModel. 

11. Once inserted into the GSModel Dataset LOD hierarchy, there is no 
mandatory requirement to clip the contents of a GSModel Tile-LOD 
against its Tile-LOD boundaries.  However, the contents of the GSModel 
Tile-LOD cannot protrude Tile-LODs by more than ½ the dimension of 
the Tile-LOD. 

12. There is no mandatory requirement to have consecutive GSModel-LODs 
in consecutive LODs of Tile-LOD hierarchy; it is permissible to have gaps 
within the Tile-LOD hierarchy. 

13. Gaps in the LOD file hierarchy of the GSFeature Dataset are not 
permitted.  This may result in Tile-LODs that are empty (e.g. without any 
GSFeatures).  The presence of an empty Tile-LOD file for the GSFeature 
Dataset indicates the availability of modeled content invoked by finer 
LODs of the GSFeature hierarchy. 

6.12.1.3 Example – Insertion of a GSModel with 3 LODs into the CDB Hierarchy 
Consider an industrial building 200m wide x 200m length x 10m high.  The modeler has 
not supplied any values for its Significant Size, nor has he provided a value for RTAI.  It 
is modeled in three distinct levels of detail as follows: 

a) Coarsest level: 5 polygons 
b) Mid level: 60 polygons 
c) Finest level: 300 polygons 

Based on this information, we can derive Significant Size values for each of the modeled 
representation as follows and determine where within the hierarchy each of the 
GSModel-LODs should be inserted: 

 
a. Coarsest level-of-detail: 

a. Compute the model’s Significant Size … 

𝑆𝑆 =  
10×.96)×200 +  200×200×.259 

𝜋  

𝑆𝑆 =  62.5𝑚 
b. Since the model is opaque and has no assigned value for RTAI, the 

final value for SS’ is 62.5m. 
c.  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the 

(coarsest LOD) of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD 3 of 
the Tile-LOD (assuming its file size limit is not exceeded) 

b. Mid level-of-detail: 
a. Compute the ratio of vertices

d. d. Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the (mid- 
LOD) of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD = 5 of the Tile-
LOD (assuming its file size limit is not exceeded)

final value for 𝑆𝑆′!"# is 8.07. 

d. d. Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the 
(finest-LOD) of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD = 6 of 
the Tile-LOD (assuming its file size limit is not exceeded) 

6.12.2 T2DModels 
The T2DModels are stored in the OpenFlight format.  The CDB conventions described 
herein are designed to facilitate the integration of such models onto the terrain tile, hence 
the name “Tiled 2D Models”.  Each 2DModel can have one or more modeled 
representation (called a 2DModel-LOD) that represents the feature to a certain level of 
fidelity.  2DModel-LODs are re-grouped into T2DModel Tile-LODs; this re-grouping 
approach is designed to reduce the overheads associated with the access of 2DModel-
LODs.  Furthermore, T2DModel-LODs can be accessed without a prior reference to a 
corresponding feature in the GSFeature dataset. 

The integration of T2DModels to the underlying terrain skin is performed by the client-
devices at runtime.  Historically, this integration has always been performed by the tools 
and was “baked-in” into the SE terrain skin during the offline data store generation 
process.  Many client-specific considerations went into the mechanisms required to 
support this integration and as a result, the resulting synthetic environments were very 
client-specific and did not scale easily to higher resolutions. 
In line with CDB principles, the T2DModel Dataset defers this integration and imposes it 
on the consumers (not the producers) of synthetic environments.  As a result, client-
devices can independently access, manage and control each dataset, i.e., the Primary 
Elevation, the VSTI Imagery, the T2DModel, etc.  This layered approach to synthetic 
environment production and consumption provides a much greater level of abstraction 



53 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

between the SE data model and the data models internal to each client-device.  It is 
understood, that the deferral of the integration process imposes added functionality and 
computational requirements on the part of the CDB client-devices. 
While it would be possible, in theory, to use the T2DModel Dataset for the modeling of 
the terrain skin, this use-case is specifically forbidden because the T2DModel Dataset 
does not provide a guarantee of full tile coverage.  As a result, the Primary Elevation 
Dataset is always required regardless of whether a corresponding Tile-LOD of the 
T2DModel is present or not.  Furthermore, since CDB forbids the duplication of 
information, the terrain skin cannot be duplicated by the T2DModel Dataset. 
Client-devices must always access the Primary Elevation prior to any other raster 
datasets.  Once a Tile-LOD of the Primary Elevation is loaded, a client-device can then 
access the T2DModel Dataset at an “appropriate” LOD6.  Following this, the client-
device must integrate the models found within the T2DModel Tile-LOD with the terrain 
found in the Primary Elevation dataset. 

6.12.2.1 T2DModel Levels-of-detail 
As with 3D features, 2D features can have modeled representations at varying levels of 
detail.  Each of these modeled-representations is referred to as a 2DModel-LOD.  A 
2DModel-LOD consists of a group of polygons that represent a 2D feature at a specific 
level-of-detail. 
Once a 2DModel-LOD is inserted into the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy, it is then 
referred to as a T2DModel-LOD.  The insertion of a 2DModel-LOD into the LOD 
hierarchy of the T2DModel Dataset is solely dependent on its Location, its Significant 
Size and on its Storage Size.  2DModel-LODs are regrouped into files called T2DModel 
Tile-LODs.  Note that when a 2DModel is clipped to the T2DModel’s Tile-LOD 
boundaries, each of the clipped model fragments will appear in distinct OpenFlight files 
of the T2DModel Dataset.  The T2DModel Tile-LODs are assembled into a hierarchy of 
Tile-LODs called the T2DModel Dataset. 
The organization of the modeled content into files that contain co-located objects of 
similar size greatly improves runtime performance.  The location and Significant Size of 
a 2DModel-LOD determines where it is nominally inserted into the T2DModel LOD 
hierarchy.  This approach ensures that the modeled content is organized in files that 
contain co-located objects of similarly size.  This approach provides client-device with an 
optimal means of accessing and filtering modeled content (by location and by size). 
2DModel-LODs are accumulated into Tiles for each LOD of the T2DModel hierarchy.  
The size of these T2DModel Tiles is capped to T2DModelFileSize7.  In the event that the 
insertion of a 2DModel-LOD causes this limit to be exceeded, the 2DModel-LODs that 
are deemed to have the lowest contribution to the Tile are moved to finer Tiles of the 
T2DModel hierarchy until the Tile is once again within its size limit.  In the event that the 
                                                
6  In this context, “appropriate” means a LOD that falls within the capabilities of the client-device. 

7  The T2DModelFileSize storage size limit for T2DModel Tile-LODs is critical in achieving 
runtime determinism. 



54 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

2DModel-LOD is larger than T2DModelFileSize, the 2DModel-LOD can be moved to the 
4 finer Tiles of the T2DModel hierarchy and clipped against the Tile boundaries as 
illustrated in Figure 6-17: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows within the T2DModel Dataset 
Hierarchy.  This approach ensures that the modeled content is accessible in chunks that 
are bounded; this is critical to the effective allocation and management of memory in the 
client-devices as well as improving client-device performance and determinism. 

 
 

NOTE:  The Significant Size of a 2DModel-LOD determines where it is 
nominally inserted into the T2DModel LOD hierarchy.  In this nominal 
case, each Tile-LOD of the T2DModel Dataset holds a group of 
2DModel-LODs that have similar Significant Sizes.  This enables the 
client-devices to determine the range at which the T2DModel-LOD can 
be optimally blended into the scene so that the model falls within a 
specified angular error criterion. 

 
The bounding criterion of T2DModel Tiles can lead to LOD migration, thus 

breaking the relationship between the Significant Size of a 2DModel-
LOD and the nominal CDB LOD it belongs to.  As a result, client-devices 
can no longer guarantee the range at which the 2DModel-LOD will be 
blended into the scene.  In effect, each time the 2DModel-LOD is 
migrated by one LOD, the client-device will likely shorten the range at 
which it is blended into the scene by a factor of 2, leading to potentially 
distracting artifacts.  The severity of the artifacts is proportional to the 
amount of content that has migrated to finer LODs and to the number of 
LODs by which the content has moved. 

 
While the CDB Standard allows the migration of 2DModel-LODs to finer 

LODs when Tile-LODs overflows are encountered, it is understood that 
this may lead to rendering artifacts that might be considered 
unsatisfactory.  Consequently, it is strongly recommended that tools 
(that generate the CDB hierarchy) be designed to optionally 
disallow the migration of T2DModel-LODs to finer LODs upon 
overflows, and instead flag the overflow condition and then abort.  
Upon such cases, modelers can then re-assess which T2DModels 
should be discarded or remodeled in order to simultaneously satisfy the 
CDB bounding criteria and the application requirements. 

Each of the Tile-LODs of the T2DModel Dataset is nominally configured as exchange-
LODs (aka substitution-LODs) as defined in chapter 6. 
The exchange-LOD mechanism assumes that client-devices gradually substitute a coarser 
Tile-LOD with a four finer Tile-LODs. 
While this exchange-LOD mechanism is simple, it can lead to inefficiencies when 
extremely fine features cause the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended by several 
LODs.  Consider the case of 13m road lines overlaid with 6 cm stripe lines.  As we will 
see in the following section, insertion of the Stripe line would nominally occur at 



55 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

LOD=7 of the T2DModel hierarchy while the Road line would occur at LOD=-1.  The 
Stripe lines force the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended (and clipped) to 8 
additional LODs.  In effect, the Road lines are repeated8 in LODs 0 through 7 leading to 
important storage inefficiencies and greater computational burden by the client-devices. 

 

 
Figure 6-17: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows within the T2DModel Dataset Hierarchy 

In order to resolve this use-case, the T2DModel Dataset is post-processed and subjected 
to a “compaction” process, starting from the finest LOD (e.g. LODmax) and progressing to

hierarchy

the coarser levels.  The compaction process takes the content of the Tile-LODs located at 
LODmax and packs them as an additive LODs of the parent Tile-LOD at (LODmax – 1) of 
the parent Tile-LOD.  The process is recursively applied to the coarser LODs until the 
parent LOD is packed to capacity.  This approach ensures that the modeled content is 
accessible in similarly-sized chunks of processing; this provides the means to improve 
internal parallelism and pipelining (ie. improves client-device determinism). The result is 
a LOD hierarchy which is less deep, and with content which is more uniformly 
distributed; both of these characteristics improve runtime performance and determinism. 

The T2DModel LOD structure is continuous i.e. there is no gap in the LOD hierarchy.  
This means that once a 2DModel-LOD is inserted into a finer level of the T2DModel 
hierarchy, the same 2DModel-LOD is propagated to coarser LODs until a coarser 
2DModel-LOD is available. 

Note that some client-devices may be sensitive to the precision of clipped vertices; some 
client-devices may demand that the clipped vertices be shared at the tile boundary 
between two tiles of the same LODs.  This can be done as follow: 

- The X coordinate (longitude) of clipped vertices along the top or bottom 
edges of the tile can be used to uniquely identify the matching coordinate in 
an adjacent tile. 

- The Y coordinate (latitude) of clipped vertices along the right or left edges 
of the tiles can be used to uniquely identify the matching coordinate in an 
adjacent tile.

6.12.2.2 CDB LOD versus T2DModel Significant Size 
Section 6.8.3 of the CDB Standard Volume 6: OGC CDB Rules for Encoding Data using 
OpenFlight provides a set of guidelines to establish the values for Significant Size SSc 
and SSLOD for T2D Models (for both lines and polygons). 

Table 3 32: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size, shows us the relationship between 
SSc and SSLOD.  They are offset by 3 LODs.  The implication of this statement is in the 



58 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

case of a model with two LOD, the finer 2DModel-LOD must have sufficient detail to 
justify its existence. 

Note:  Each of the 2DModel-LODs of a 2DModel must differ by at least one 
CDB LOD.  Some 2DModel-LODs will be discarded if this relationship is 
not respected. 

Consider for example a 12m line road feature with two modeled representations.  The 
nominal CDB LOD for the coarsest 2DModel-LOD is LOD=3 in accordance to the table 
below.  The Significant Size of the finer 2DModel-LOD is obtained by “walking” around 
its outline; we determine that the largest value of d for successive vertex triplets is 3m, 
hence SSLOD = 3m.  Table 6-6: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size, tells us that the 
2DModel-LOD should also be nominally inserted at CDB LOD = 3.  Since both 
2DModel-LODs have the same nominal CDB LOD, only one of them is retained 
(preferably the more detailed of the two)

6.12.2.3  Rules Governing T2DModel LOD Hierarchy 
Here is a summary of the rules required by the standard in order to ensure deterministic 
operation from client-devices: 

1. Each feature may have multiple modeled representations at progressively 
coarser levels of detail.  Each of the modeled representations is referred to 
as a 2DModel-LOD.  In absence of pre-modeled coarser LOD 
representations, the tools may automatically generate coarser modeled 
levels-of-detail. 

2. A 2DModel-LOD consists of a group of polygons that represent a feature 
at a specific level-of-detail; this group of polygons shares a common 



60 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Feature Attribute Code, a Feature Sub-Code (FSC), a Model Name 
(MODL) and 2DModel-LOD’s Significant Size SS’LOD. 

3. Each 2DModel has a distinct Significant Size value SS’ based on its 
dimensions.  In turn, each of the 2DModel-LODs of a 2DModel has a 
distinct Significant Size value SS’LOD based on its modeled accuracy. 

4. Insertion of a 2DModel-LOD into the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy 
proceeds as follows.  Starting with LODmax (LODmax is a variable set by the 
user that sets the maximum depth of the LOD hierarchy) and progressing 
to coarser LODs… 
a. For each Tile-LOD, create a Model_List that is constructed from the 

2DModel-LODs that straddle the Tile-LOD. 
i. If the 2DModel-LOD is not the coarsest LOD and its Significant 

Size is in accordance to Table 6-6: T2DModel LOD versus 
Significant Size, then iteratively simplify the 2DModel-LOD 
(iterate until its Significant Size is no longer in accordance to 
Table 6-6: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size and keep 
results of previous iteration) and add it to the Tile-LOD.  Only the 
coarser 2DModel-LODs of this 2DModel are available for future 
insertion into the T2DModel hierarchy. 

ii. If the 2DModel-LOD is the coarsest LOD of the 2DModel and its 
Significant Size is in accordance to Table 6-6: T2DModel LOD 
versus Significant Size, insert it at this LOD of the hierarchy.  If 
the 2DModel-LOD matches the Tile-LOD, remove it from the list 
for the processing of the coarser Tile-LOD. 

b. If the Model_List is less than T2DModelFileSize, no further processing 
is required. 

c. The Model_List of each Tile-LOD is sorted in decreasing order of 
Diff, where Diff is the difference between the Significant Size SS of 
the Model and the Significant Size as specified in Table 3. 

d. If the Model_List is greater than T2DModelFileSize, then (starting 
with the first entry in the sorted Model_List), Models are simplified 
one-by-one until the size of the Model_List is less than 
T2DModelFileSize.  When a simplification occurs, the Model_List is 
re-sorted using the Diff value. 

e. If a) the Model_List is deemed non-reducible and b) the Model_List is 
still greater than T2DModelFileSize … 
i. If LOD < LODmax, then… 

(1) a Temp_Model_List is created and initialized with the  
contents of the Model_list.  Starting from the end of the 
Model_List, Models are removed one-by-one from the 
Model_list (starting with the first Model in the Model_List) 
and are copied into the Temp_Model_List until the Model_List 
reaches T2DModelFileSize. 

(2) The Temp_Model_List is merged to the children Tile-LODs 
and the children are re-processed using steps 4a to 4e.  The 



61 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

process is iterative, i.e., the “overflow” is propagated into the 
finer LODs of the T2DModel hierarchy. 

ii. Else… 
(1) Models are removed one-by-one, starting with the first Model 

in the Model_List, until the Model_List is less than 
T2DModelFileSize.  The corresponding T2DModels are 
removed from the CDB and a warning is issued stating that 
content was removed. 
 

NOTE: The algorithm preserves the highest available modeled content 
while ensuring that the runtime constraint file size limits are respected.  
While the CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized 2DModel-LODs, a 
client-device may refuse to render the 2DModel-LOD if it has insufficient 
memory to load all of the OpenFlight files that make-up the 2DModel-
LOD. 

 
5. Each T2DModel Tile-LOD is subject to an OpenFlight file size limit of 

T2DModelFileSize, i.e., several OpenFlight files, each within the 
T2DModelFileSize file size limit, can be used to represent a very complex 
T2DModel Tile-LOD.  Each of T2DModel-LODs of an T2DModel Tile-
LOD share the same T2DModel-LOD Identifier (see rule 2) 

6. Each Tile-LOD is subject to a file size limit of T2DModelFileSize. 
7. All of the 2DModel-LODs in a T2DModel Tile-LOD are nominally 

exchange-LODs (see exception in next rule). 
8. The depth of the T2DModel LOD hierarchy should be reduced by folding-

in the Tile-Models_List of finer Tile-LODs as an additive LOD to the 
Tile-Model_List of a coarser Tile-LOD.  Failure to perform this 
“compaction step” may result in significantly deeper T2DModel LOD 
hierarchy when the finest 2DModel-LODs consist of small details (e.g., 
thin stripes and markings on roads), and reduce the paging performance of 
client-devices. 

9. The finer modeled representation of a T2DModel (i.e., a 2DModel-LOD 
with a smaller Significant Size) always appears in finer LODs of the Tile-
LOD hierarchy than a coarser 2DModel-LOD. 

10. A Tile-LOD cannot contain more than one 2DModel-LOD of the same 
T2DModel. 

11. All T2DModels are clipped against the Tile-LOD boundaries. 
12. Gaps in the LOD file hierarchy of the T2DModel Dataset are not 

permitted.  This may result in Tile-LODs that are empty (e.g., without any 
T2DModels).  The presence of an empty Tile-LOD file indicates the 
availability of content in T2DModel files located in finer LODs of the 
T2DModel hierarchy.

6.13 Guideline: Examples of Vector Dataset Usages (Was A.20) 
Formerly Annex A.20 in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 2. 

6.13.1 Linear Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of a linear model in a CDB data store 
for a typical radar client-device. 
The radar application first extracts the line features from the CDB data stores and 
constructs an object.  The constructed object contains the necessary information for the 
radar to compute the equivalent radar image using the radar cross-section (RCS) of the 
line features with material attributes and directivity, etc. 

 

NOTE: With the introduction of version 3.2 of the CDB Specification, it is 
recommended that the terrain-conformal features be modeled using 
T2DModels and that radar client-devices use this modeled representation 
instead of the vector line and polygon features. 

 
Figure 6-20: Example of Line Features, illustrates three line features stored in the tile in 
in a vector data set.  The junction nodes of each line feature represents the start and end 
junctions of the line feature.  In this example, there is only one chain per line feature. 

 
Figure 6-20: Example of Line Features 

The radar uses the position of the lineal coordinates to construct a line representation of 
the radar image.  It extracts the line feature information from the chains to construct an 
internal local representation.  The necessary information needed by radar is:

1. Network Datasets:  
The datasets along with the Feature Attribution Code indicate if the feature is a 
road, a highway, or river for example.  In the above illustration, we have a river, a 
powerline and a railway.  The CDB Standard represents this in the *.dbf file of 
the Shapefile representation. 

2. Composite Material IndeX (CMIX):  
The Composite Material IndeX attribute points to the Composite Material Table 
and provides the Radar the types of Base Materials that the feature is made of.  
This information is used, in addition to the geometry of the line feature or a 
generic RCS, to provide a radar signature of the target, which is proportional to 
the reflection value of the various materials.  The intensity of the radar image 
represents the interaction of the simulated Radar Beam with the features in the 
synthetic environment.  Each line contains a reference to a composite material 
which in turn is mapped to a reflectivity factor value in the radar simulation. 

3. Width (WGP):  
The width of the line features is also taken into consideration.  This information is 
part of the vector data used to construct a 2D radar image of the terrain.  The 
width information is encoded as an attribute of the line feature. 

4. Height (HGT):  
The height of the line feature is used to indicate the height of each point/line with 
respect to the terrain height. 
 
NOTE: The height value is a delta height above the terrain and is only provided 
for objects that require it such as the powerlines or the train tracks in this 
example. The height property is especially valuable to radar client-devices 
because erect objects in the data store produce significant returns and occultation 
areas in the displayed radar image.  The height property can be assigned to the 
train tracks, long fences and the powerlines each with average altitudes. 

5. Position:  
This information is contained in the line *.shp files.  The x and y coordinate of 
each point is extracted from those objects.

Figure 6-21: Radar Beam Simulation 

The radar then uses a beam simulation to process the above information and construct an 
image representing the content of each small beam sections.  The intersection of the beam 
pie slice is compared with the line feature’s position and converted into an image whose 
intensity is based on the computed RCS of the line features.  As mentioned above, the 
RCS value (which is modeled internally in the radar simulation) takes into account the 
properties (which are derived from the attributes) of each line feature. 

6.13.2 Road Following Example 
Figure 6-22: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network, illustrates how 
line features can be used to describe a navigable network; the example could represent a 
network of roads.  First, the application reads a vector line file describing the chains, then 
the vector point file describing the junction nodes.  For each junction nodes the 
application makes up a list of attached chains ending up with a network as illustrated in 
Figure 6-22: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network, where there are six 
chains (labeled in this example as CSLID1 to CSLID6) that are joined through 
intersection nodes (labeled in this example as CSZID1 to CSZID6).  The small black dots 
represent points forming the segments of a chain; they are essentially used to describe the 
deviation from a straight line between nodes. 
In Figure 6-22: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network, the green line 
shows an example of what a shortest path algorithm could determine if asked to find the 
shortest route between CSZID1 and CSZID5 based on the lengths of the chains.  First, 
the algorithm would move to CSZID2 via the chain CSLID1; when at CSZID2 it has two 
alternatives, either take CSLID4 or use CSLID3 and CSLID6.  In our example it would 
have determined that the latter alternative is the shortest path; the entity would then 
follow the path given by the green line going through all the segments in the chains.

6.13.3 Point Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of a point feature as modeled in the 
CDB data store for a typical radar client-device.  The radar client-device extracts the 
point feature from the data store using the format described in the Standard and 
constructs an object.  The constructed object will contain the necessary information for 
the radar to compute the equivalent radar image using the radar cross-section (RCS) of 
the object over the terrain; the RCS is derived from the point features characteristics. 

NOTE: The example below illustrates the use of point-feature data by a radar client-
device.  However, we recommend that the radar client-devices use the 
modeled representation of the feature rather than the feature location, type 
and attribution data. 

In Figure 6-23: Objects Represented on a Terrain Tile, a series of different objects are 
represented on a terrain tile.  The objects are modeled as single point of zero dimensions 
in radar.  The radar will position the different points according to their geographic 
position and altitude.  The height data corresponds to a height of the feature with respect 
to the terrain.

Figure 6-23: Objects Represented on a Terrain Tile 

The necessary information needed by radar is typically: 

1. Feature Code: This information indicates if the feature is a tree, a pylon, or a 
church for example.  In the above drawing this would mean a tree, an industry, a 
house or a radio station antenna. 

2. Composite Material IndeX (CMIX): The Composite Material IndeX attribute 
points to the Composite Material Table and provides the Radar client-device with 
the type of material that the feature is made of.  This information is used, in 
addition to the width of the point feature, to provide a generic RCS of the target, 
which is proportional to the reflection value of the various materials.  The RCS is 
then used by radar to determine the intensity of the radar image representing the 
point feature, based on the aspect and grazing angles to the Radar Beam.  Each 
point contains a reference to a Composite Material. 

3. Bounding Sphere Radius (BSR): The radius of the point is also taken into 
consideration.  This information is part of the vector data used to construct a 2D 
radar image of the terrain.  The width is part of the point object attributes. 

4. Height (HGT): Since the radar sees the terrain with a perspective angle that can 
be computed using the radar altitude and the feature distance, the height of objects 
on the terrain becomes important to create the radar display image.  This attribute 
of the point is used to indicate the differential height of each point with respect to 
the terrain height.  In the example above, the trees all have the same average 
altitude.  The other point features have different height. 

5. Position: The object point location in the CDB data store.  The x and y coordinate 
of each point is extracted from those objects.  The position when combined with 
the delta heights will create a pseudo-3D point feature object.

6. Orientation (AO1): The radar needs the orientation of each point feature.  This is 
needed because radar has a series of RCS tables, one for each of the Feature 
Identification Code.  Those RCS tables give the RCS value for each incident 
angle of the radar beam.  This angle is computed by taking into account the radar 
beam angle and the point feature orientation.  For example, in the above drawing, 
the radio antenna has an orientation of 90 degrees.  This means that if a radar 
beam comes from the right and points to the antenna at 270 degrees, the RCS 
value will be at maximum.  The radar simulation would use a RCS table that 
represents the RCS with respect to the incident angle as follows: 

 
Figure 6-24: Incident Angle 

 

 
Figure 6-25: Beam Simulation 

The radar then uses a beam simulation to process the above information and construct an 
image representing the content of each small beam sections.  The intersection of the beam 
pie slice is compared with the point’s position and converted into an image whose 



68 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

intensity is based on the computed RCS of the points.  As mentioned above, this RCS 
takes into account the attributes of each point feature. 

If the size of the object referred to by the point feature is much larger than a specific 
threshold, the simulation could in addition use the MODL field of that point feature to 
extract a more precise geometrical 3D model from the CDB to increase the simulation 
fidelity. 

6.13.4 Polygon Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of a polygon feature as modeled in the 
CDB for a radar client-device. 

NOTE: With the introduction of version 3.2 of the CDB Standard, we recommend that 
the terrain-conformal features be modeled using T2DModels and that radar 
client-devices use this modeled representation instead of the vector linear 
and polygon features. 

In a manner similar to the line example, the Radar extracts this polygon from the data 
store using the Shape (*.shp) file and construct a tile in its memory.  The constructed tile 
will contain the necessary information for the radar to compute the equivalent radar 
image using the radar cross-section (RCS) of the represented surface polygon over the 
terrain intersecting the Radar beam. 

In Figure 6-26: Four Polygon Features Stored in the Tile, four polygon features are stored 
in the tile with their surface material and feature classification attributes.  Each of the 
features points to an array of segments. 

 
Figure 6-26: Four Polygon Features Stored in the Tile 



69

The radar simulation uses the segment coordinates to construct a polygonal 
representation on the radar image.  It extracts the polygon feature attribute information 
from the segments and constructs its tile data in memory.  The necessary information 
needed by the radar simulation is typically: 

 
• Feature Code: 

This information is the identification of the surface feature.  It indicates if the 
polygon feature represents a forest, a lake, or an airport runway for example.  In 
the above drawing, this would translate to a forested area, a grassy area, a 
concrete section and a dual runway intersection. 

• Composite Material IndeX (CMIX): 
The Composite Material IndeX Surface Material Code attribute points to the 
Composite Material Table and provides to the Radar with the type of material that 
the feature is made of.  This information is used, in addition to the shape of the 
polygon feature, to provide a generic RCS of the simulated area.  This RCS is 
proportional to the reflection value of the various materials constituting the 
polygon or the simulated texture of its components (e.g., an industrial area made 
up of metallic roofs).  The RCS is then used by radar to determine the intensity of 
the radar image representing the polygon feature, based on the aspect and grazing 
angles to the Radar Beam.  Each chain will contain a reference to a material 
namespace object in the CDB. 

• Height (HGT): 
Normally, the radar simulation sees the terrain with a perspective angle that can 
be computed using the radar altitude and the feature distance.  Because of this 
angle, the height of objects on the terrain becomes important to create the image 
that the radar “sees”.  This attribute of the chain is used to indicate the average 
height of each polygon object.  In the example above, the forested area could be 
elevated to roughly 25 or 30 feet to produce a forest ”canopy” which will look 
elevated to the radar. 

The following image shows how a typical radar beam would intersect the different parts 
of polygon features that are part of the terrain represented previously. 
Figure 6-27: Radar Beam Simulation, shows the radar using a beam simulation to extract 
the above information and construct an image representing the content of each small 
beam sections (aka bins).  The intersection of the beam pie slice is performed against the 
polygon feature polygons.  Then the material of the polygon falling in the beam bin is 
converted into image intensity, which is relative to the computed RCS of that polygon’s 
material.  As mentioned above, this RCS takes into account the attributes of the segment 
of each polygon feature.
