i. Abstract 
This CDB volume provides all of the information required to store Radar Cross Section 
(RCS) data within a conformant CDB data store.   

Please note that the current CDB standard only provides encoding rules for using Esri 
ShapeFiles for storing RCS models. However, this Best Practice has been modified to 
change most of the ShapeFile references to “vector data sets” or “vector attributes” and 
“Point Shapes” to “Point geometries”. This was done in recognition that future versions 
of the CDB standard and related Best Practices will provide guidance on using other 
encodings/formats, such as OGC GML. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

ogcdoc, OGC document, cdb, radar, radar cross section, models, rcs, shapefile

1. Scope 

This CDB Best Practice (BP) defines a RCS (Radar Cross-Section) model representation 
for use by Sensor Simulation client-devices such as Radar and/or Sonar.  The BP 
provides a signature model representing the overall relative reflectivity levels of a given 
Model Representation when viewed at discrete azimuth and elevation angles.  The RCS 
data is then used in range and aspect calculations for the detection and classification of 
simulated targets (either static or moving). 

For ease of editing and review, the original CDB specification has been separated into 12

6. Radar Cross Section Models 

For devices such as Radar, a geometric representation of a model may often provide a 
level of fidelity which is insufficient or inappropriate for use in simulation.  Alternately, 
it may not be feasible to compute a radar cross-section of the model in real-time.  Further, 
a user may wish to incorporate real-world RCS data into the simulator client-devices in 
order to further improve simulation fidelity.  To this end, this document defines a RCS 
(Radar Cross-Section) model representation for use by Sensor Simulation client-devices 
such as Radar and/or Sonar.  This model provides a signature model representing the 
overall relative reflectivity levels of a given Model Representation when viewed at 
discrete azimuth and elevation angles.  The RCS data is then used in range and aspect 
calculations for the detection and classification of simulated targets (either ground or 
moving). 

The following Section 6 Clauses provide a primer on radar, basic principles of operation 
and radar cross sections (RCS).

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of a target is a measure of the radar reflection 
characteristics of a target (usually expressed in m2, dBsm, or volts).  It is equal to the 
power reflected back to the radar divided by power density of the wave striking the 
target.  For most targets, the radar cross-section corresponds to the area of the cross 
section of the sphere that would reflect the same energy back to the radar, if a metal 
sphere were substituted.  A sphere is sometimes used since the RCS of a sphere is 
independent of frequency if operating in the far field region of the radar (Reference [24]). 

 
The RCS data unit of measure for the intensity are usually referenced as a normalized 
ratio in Decibels relative to a square meter (reference [25]), or otherwise known as dBsm.  
Another data measure that is linked to the intensity measure is also the ‘phase shift’ angle 
(in degrees) of the returned energy.  It can provide some additional information about the 
reflective attributes of the elements reflecting back to the radar. 
However, the RCS defines the echo at the radar for the model (target) in question, which 
varies considerably depending on the target’s orientation, its relative distance and size 
with respect to the simulated radar’s antenna.  The viewing angles are shown in the 
diagram below. 

 

 
Figure A-19: Relative Azimuth (α) and Elevation (φ) Angles 

 
RCS curves are normally produced using highly specialized off-line tools which input the 
model geometry and material attributes (typically an OpenFlight file) and applies 
physics-based processing like geometric ray-tracing, optical reflections/refractions, 
corner detection, material absorption and so on to the geometric data representation of the 
model.  This processing is computationally expensive and is usually performed in non 
real-time.  The end-result of this computation (usually 2D arrays of data points in 
elevation and azimuth) provides data that can be used more efficiently by simulation 
modeling such as radar at run-time.  Those data curves are stored in a polar-type 
representation table, which provide specific reflectivity levels given a set of azimuth and 
elevation aspect angles.

6.1 Functional Description 
To simulate a target for most modes of operation, the Radar software uses an RCS Polar 
Diagram as shown below: 

 

 
Figure A-20: Polar Diagram of RCS data in Decibels at a given elevation angle 
 

The polar diagram allows the radar to use an RCS value array (indexed by 
azimuth/elevation angles) for getting an approximation of the overall RCS of distant 
targets.  The approximated RCS data is a function of the model’s materials, geometry, 
view angles, and multi-paths reflections generated within the model itself. 

 
RCS data can also be depicted more linearly as shown in the following diagram: 

 
Figure A-21: Linear Diagram of RCS data in Decibels at a given elevation angle

As can be seen in the example above, relative intensities are much greater when viewing 
the model directly in front (0° azimuth), from the back (±180° azimuth) and on the sides 
(-90° and +90° azimuth). 

 
The RCS data is often characterized by its data resolution and physical modeling 
parameters.  The data resolution determines the angular increments between successive 
RCS values, and modeling parameters specify the attributes of the physical parameters 
used to drive the RCS mathematical model computations (such as the Electro-Magnetic 
properties of the simulated electric field). 

 
Both wavelength and polarization affect how a radar system “sees” the elements in the 
scene.  Therefore, radar using different polarization and wavelength combinations may 
provide different and complementary information, which can be used to enhance the 
radar image in a specific way. 

6.2 Wave Polarization 
When computing an RCS model, it is important to consider microwave energy 
propagation and scattering, and also the polarization of the radiation, which is an 
important property.  For a plane electromagnetic (EM) wave, polarization refers to the 
locus of the electric field vector in the plane perpendicular to the direction of 
propagation.  The length of the vector represents the amplitude of the wave, and the 
rotation rate of the vector represents the frequency of the wave.  Polarization refers to the 
orientation and shape of the pattern traced by the tip of the vector (Reference [23]). 

 

 
Figure A-22: Horizontal and Vertical Polarization of a plane of EM wave 

 
The waveform of the electric field strength (voltage) of an EM wave can be predictable 
(the wave is polarized) or random (the wave is un-polarized), or a combination of both. In 
the latter case, the degree of polarization describes the ratio of polarized power to total 
power of the wave.  An example of a fully polarized wave would be a monochromatic 
sine wave, with a single, constant frequency and stable amplitude. 



 

11 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
Many types of radar antennae are designed to transmit and/or receive microwave 
radiation that is either horizontally (H) or vertically (V) polarized, or a combination of 
both.  A transmitted wave of either polarization can generate a backscattered wave with a 
variety of polarizations, thus an equal amount of resulting RCS curves. 

 
Polarization type on either transmission or reception mode can be synthesized by using H 
and V components, with a well-defined relationship between them. For this reason, 
systems that transmit and receive both of these linear polarizations are commonly used.  
With these radars, there can be four combinations of transmit and receive polarizations: 

 
HH - for horizontal transmit and horizontal receive 
VV - for vertical transmit and vertical receive 
HV - for horizontal transmit and vertical receive, and 
VH - for vertical transmit and horizontal receive. 
 

The first two polarization combinations are referred to as “like-polarized” because 
transmit and receive polarization types are the same.  The last two combinations are 
referred to as “cross-polarized” because transmit and receive polarizations are orthogonal 
to one another. 
Radar systems can have one, two, or all four of these transmit/receive polarization 
combinations.  Examples include the following types of radar systems: 

 
Single polarized HH or VV (or possibly HV or VH) 
Dual polarized HH and HV, VV and VH, or HH and 

VV 
Alternating polarization HH and HV, alternating with VV and 

VH 
Polarimetric HH, VV, HV, and VH 

 
Both wavelength and polarization affect how a radar system “sees” the elements in the 
scene.  Therefore, radar using different polarization and wavelength combinations may 
provide different and complementary information, which can be used to enhance the 
radar image in a specific way. 
Therefore, polarization information is an important part of the CDB’s RCS Data 
representation.

6.3 Wave Parameters 
In addition to the wave polarization explained above, other physical parameters of the 
modeled electromagnetic wave are also a contributing factor to the RCS of a target when 
seen by Radar.  Therefore those parameters are available in conjunction with the RCS 
data curves: 

Those parameters are generally as follows: 
 

- Radar Mode (Continuous wave or Pulsed) 
- Radiating Frequency 
- Antenna Main Lobe Gain 
- Antenna Main Lobe Bandwidth 
- Antenna Side Lobe 3dB point 
- Radar Pulse width (if pulsed radar mode) 
- Radar Pulse Repetition Frequency (if pulsed radar mode) 

7. RCS Data Model 

7.1 Radar Cross Section Data Model 
The Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of a target is a measure of the radar reflection 
characteristics of a target (usually expressed in m2, dBsm, or volts).  It is equal to the 
power reflected back to the radar divided by power density of the wave striking the 
target.  For most targets, the radar cross-section corresponds to the area of the cross 
section of the sphere that would reflect the same energy back to the radar, if a metal 
sphere were substituted.  A sphere is sometimes used since the RCS of a sphere is 
independent of frequency if operating in the far field region of the radar.  The following 
sections define the requirements for an RCS in a conformant CDB data store. 

7.2 RCS Data Model 
The CDB RCS data is organized so that client-devices can easily retrieve the following 
information from the RCS model (Figure 7-1: Graphical Representation of the 3D Model 
RCS Vector Data) below: 

• The modeling (physical) parameters that were used to generate the RCS polar data. 
• The RCS polar representation corresponding to one or more levels of resolution of 

the RCS polar data. 
• The RCS polar representation corresponding to distinct radar mode of operation. 
• The RCS polar representation corresponding to a distinct radar model type. 
 



 

13 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

RCS resolution refers to the angular pitch used in gathering RCS data for the model in 
question.  At a given RCS resolution, it is possible to have two or more RCS polar 
representations due to the fact that the RCS data is computed based on a number of 
physical modeling properties such as the characteristics of the electromagnetic beam, its 
frequency, polarization, amplitude and phase.  A simulated sensor operating in a given 
mode of operation, over a given range of frequencies, will require the RCS data closest to 
this mode.  It will therefore need to use the closest matching Polar Diagram from the 
RCS model data. 

7.3 RCS Polar Diagram Data Representation using Shapefile 
This section provides a detailed description of the content and format of RCS data for a 
conformant implementation of a CDB data store. 

7.3.1 Shapefile Internal Data Structure 
 

Requirement 1     

Req 1 req/cdb-radar/storage 

Within a CDB, the RCS model SHALL be stored as a series of Esri’s ShapeFiles in 
accordance with the Esri Shapefile Specification2.  

 

This section describes the vector data structure for the representation of RCS model data.  
This format provides the required flexibility to create and visualize the RCS data 
including: 

• Easy modification of data attributes 
• Simple visualization of RCS data in polar form 
• Allow irregular steps in azimuth/elevation (X/Y) 
• Allow some possibly missing values 
 

RCS data is inherently two-dimensional in nature and is naturally organized as a two-
dimensional array of RCS polar values computed at various azimuth and elevation angles 
from the target.  Each element of this array represents the RCS data value over each 
uniformly distributed azimuth angle and distinct elevation angle. 

Therefore, each of such array element can be represented as a “Point” geometry, with the 
azimuth angle value (X) at a given elevation angle (Y), while at the same time storing the 
associated attributes such as the RCS, Amplitude or Phase data in the instance attribute

database (dbf file) associated to the vector data, currently a Shapefile.  Typical azimuth 
angles would range between -180° and +180°, whereas the elevation angles would cover 
from -90° to +90°.  However, the RCS data set could potentially only cover just a partial 
range of those angles if data is incomplete for example.  This can be visualized in the 
next diagram, showing RCS values at various azimuth angles corresponding to an 
elevation angle of 20° with respect to the model (cube).  Note that the axis conventions 
follow those described in Section 6.3, Coordinate Systems. 

 
Figure 7-1: Graphical Representation of the 3D Model RCS Vector Data 

Partial RCS data is permitted, i.e., it is permitted to cover a sub-region of the RCS polar 
diagram with only points corresponding to known values. 

For example, consider an RCS model consisting of data values in 5o elevation increments 
and 2o azimuth increments covering the entire aspect angle range of the target.  The CDB 
representation would consist of (180°/5°)+1 = 37 sets of (360°/2°)+1 = 181 points 
(vertices) for a full target aspect coverage; yielding 6697 point shapes with their attribute 
data.   

Requirement 2   

Req 2 req/cdb-radar/storage-vertices 



 

15 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

For each of the vector point vertices, the X component SHALL represent the azimuth 
angle (equivalent to longitude) and the Y component SHALL represent the elevation 
angle (equivalent to latitude); the RCS value (and other attributes) SHALL be stored in 
the instance attributes within the DBF file.-azimuth 

 

 

 

Requirement 3  

Req 3 req/cdb-radar/storage-sig-angle 

The eight prescribed values for azimuth and elevation increments SHALL be used for 
specifying the ModelSignature Significant Angle.  The table below shows the 
correspondence between the ModelSignature LOD level number and the 
ModelSignature Significant Angle. 

 

Table 7-1: ModelSignature Significant Angle per LOD 

ModelSignature LOD 
level Significant Angle Number of values 

0 90° ≤ Significant angle Less than 8 
1 45° ≤ Significant angle < 90° between 8 and 32 
2 22.5° ≤ Significant angle < 45° between 32 and 128 
3 11.25° ≤ Significant angle < 22.5° between 128 and 512 
4 5.625° ≤ Significant angle < 11.25° between 512 and 2048 
5 2.80° ≤ Significant angle < 5.625° between 8192 and 32768 
6 1.40° ≤ Significant angle < 2.80° between 32768 and 131072 
7 0.70° ≤ Significant angle < 1.40° between 131072 and 524288 

 

Such a data representation would typically produce the following diagram when viewed 
in 2D (Figure 7-2: Polar Diagram of RCS Data in Planar Representation) and 3D (Figure 
7-3: Polar Diagram of RCS Data in Spherical Representation) polar forms (color 
representing the RCS Intensity attribute):

Figure 7-3: Polar Diagram of RCS Data in Spherical Representation 

 

In addition, specific attributes within the vector data are required to specify other 
characteristics of the RCS data, like EM polarization mode and frequency that were used 
when characterizing the target’s RCS signature.  Those are the class-level attributes and 
are described below. 

Requirement 4 

Req 4 req/cdb-radar/attributes 

The data for each distinct RCS representation model SHALL have two different types 
of attributes; RCS model class attributes and RCS instance attributes as defined below. 

 

1. RCS Model Class-level attribution:  These are attributes that can be shared by all 
of the RCS model instances of the RCS representation.  The attributes and their 
values are logically re-grouped under a classname that stands for the entire

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

attributes specific to the RCS model.  All of the classnames are re-grouped into a 
model.dbf file referred to as the RCS Class Attribute file for the RCS model.  (See 
Section 7.4.1, Directory Structure)  Each row of the model.dbf file corresponds to 
a different classname.  The first column of the file is the classname attribute and 
acts as the primary key to access subsequent table entries; all other columns 
correspond to the attributes represented by the classname. 

2. RCS Instance-level attribution:  This is the data that represents a particular 
instance of the RCS model for a RCS representation.  The data is contained in the 
attribution columns of the model.dbf file that accompanies the RCS’s *.shp file.  
This *.dbf file is referred to as the RCS Instance Attribute file of the RCS model.  
(See Section 7.4.1, Directory Structure)  The first column of each row is always 
the classname attribute.  The other columns in a RCS Instance Attribute file are 
used to describe further the associated shape. 

 

Requirement 5 

Req 5 req/cdb-radar/storage-files 

In summary, for a single RCS model in the CDB, the data files SHALL consist of: 

• One *.shp main file that provides the geometric aspect (Points) for each data 
instance of a RCS model. 

• Two *.dbf files (one instance-level on a-per RCS feature basis, and one class-
level at the RCS model level) that collectively provide the attribution for all of 
the possible RCS models of a given RCS Model. 

• One *.shx index file that stores the file offsets and content lengths for each of the 
records of the main *.shp file.  The only purpose of this file is to provide a simple 
means for clients to step through the individual records of the *.shp file (i.e., it 
contains no CDB modeled data).

7.3.1.1 RCS Model Class-Level Attributes: 
Many attributes within the vector data are required to specify the physical modeling 
parameters corresponding to those used to produce the RCS data. These include, for 
instance, the electromagnetic (EM) polarization mode and the frequency that were used 
when characterizing the target’s RCS signature. 

The CDB RCS model representation offers a comprehensive set of class attributes that 
are described below.  Please note that these attributes are an elaborate set of fields to 
indicate in which physical environment the RCS data were computed and does not 
necessarily reflect a precise operating mode of a particular radar.

7.3.1.2 RCS Instance-Level Attribute Data 
The data for an entire RCS model itself is stored as a series of Point geometries, each 
representing the RCS data values with respect to the model’s center for the corresponding 
azimuth and elevation angles as represented by the point X and Y coordinates.  The *.dbf 
portion of the vector data set provides the instance attribute information for each of the 
RCS Point.  A description of the attribute information follows below: 

ShapeType = POINT 

Values: 

 X coordinate is the Azimuth angle of the RCS sample 

 Y coordinate is the Elevation angle of the RCS sample 



 

24 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

NOTE:  The RCS of the model when viewed at +90° elevation (top view) is 
significantly different than the one at -90° elevation (bottom view), 
so there should be (180/EL_STEP)+1 point values to cover all 
elevations.  The azimuth, which has the same RCS value for +180° 
and -180° will cover (360/AZ_STEP) point values.

Figure 7-4: UML Representation of the 3D Model RCS Vector Data Structure 

 

For a given RCS curve in a vector data set, an attribute “CLASSNAME” indicates which 
type of sensor application the curve data is derived for, and under which resolution the 
data was produced.  Therefore, the single vector data set of the Model can regroup all 
sensor data pertaining to various RCS signature types and resolutions for a given RCS 
Model.  Consider the next example.  The vector data format therefore should not preclude 
the capability to support multiple RCS curves simultaneously for a given model.

Requirement 6 

Req 6 req/cdb-radar/rcs-vari 

Each variant of the RCS model in the vector data set SHALL have a 10-character string 
attribute called “RCS_VARI”.  The string may contain the specific Radar model 
number (and possibly its frequency band L-Band, S-Band, X-Band, Ku-Band) for 
which this RCS variant applies to.  The suggested string convention for this field is as 
described in reference [22].

7.3.3 Model’s Articulations Effect on RCS Data 
Most man-made models (aircraft, tanks, trucks, etc.) have parts that can be articulated 
(flaps, turrets, rotating antennae, landing gears, etc).  It is impractical to pre-compute and 
store within the CDB an RCS model for every possible position of those articulated parts 
taken individually.  Instead, a CDB RCS model attribute provides the means to store an 
overall RCS variation effect, or otherwise called “scintillation effect”.  The scintillation 
effect value is added to the RCS at run-time during movement of any of such articulated 
parts of the model.  This is a parameter in the vector data attributes called “RCS_SCINT” 
and this attribute can be used by the radar client-devices at runtime to provide a 
correlated (but approximated) variation level of the model RCS while any of its parts are 
articulated. 

For example, for a tank in the process of rotating its turret, the radar simulation client 
would take its overall RCS (based on aspect angles) and add the scintillation factor on the 
end-result RCS value to slightly alter the RCS to introduce the turning turret effect while 
the part is moving.  While this adds an approximation factor on the RCS, it provides a 
coherent and correlated variation level to all clients using the RCS data set layer.  The 
“RCS_SCINT” is therefore the value that represents a scaling factor of RCS noise that 
would be superimposed while the part is being articulated.

Annex A: Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative) 

Conformance Test Class: OGC CDB Radar Cross Section (RCS) 
This section describes conformance test for the OGC CDB Radar Cross Section model. 
These abstract test cases describe the conformance criteria for verifying the structure and 
content of any data store claiming conformance to this CDB Best Practice. 

The conformance class id is “http://www.opengis.net/spec/cdb-radar/1.0/conf/” and all of 
the other conformance tests URLs are created in this path. Another issue that the reader 
should pay attention to is the test method. When the test method is assigned with 
“Visual”, it means that the purpose of the test should be “visually” investigate the file 
contents, image, or other content.  

A.1 General RCS Implementation 
The following conformance test is designed to determine if a RCS instance is a CDB 
implementation is a Shapefile. 

Conformance 1 /conf/core-radar/storage 

Requirement req/cdb-radar/storage 

Dependency Shapefile specification 

Test Test 
purpose 

Verify that the RCS model is stored as a series of Esri’s 
ShapeFiles in accordance with the Esri Shapefile 
Specification. 

Test method Visual inspection. Pass if verified 

Test type  Conformance 

 

 

A.2 Shapefile Point Vertices 
This test determines that for each of those Shapefile point vertices, the X component 
represent the azimuth angle (equivalent to longitude) and the Y component represent the 
elevation angle (equivalent to latitude); the RCS value (and other attributes) are stored in 
the instance attributes within the DBF file.-azimuth. 

Conformance 2 /conf/core-radar/storage-vertices

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Requirement 2 req/cdb-radar/storage-vertices 

Dependency Shapefile specification 

Test Test 
purpose 

Verify that point vertices follow the requirement for 
representing an RCS instance. 

Test method Visual inspection. Pass if verified 

Test type  Conformance 

 

A.3 Model Signature Significant Angle 

Test to determine if the eight prescribed values for azimuth and elevation increments are 
used for specifying the Model Signature Significant Angle. 
 
Conformance 3 /conf/core-radar/ storage-sig-angle 

Requirement 3 req/cdb-radar/storage-sig-angle 

Dependency Table showing ModelSignature LOD level number and the 
ModelSignature Significant Angle 

Test Test 
purpose 

Verify that the 8 values are used 

Test method Check values against table 7.1. 

Test type  Conformance 

A.4 RCS Attributes 

Test for conformance that the RCS data for each distinct RCS representation model has 
two different types of attributes; RCS model class attributes and RCS instance attributes 
as defined below. 
 

Conformance 4 /conf/core-radar/ attributes 

Requirement 4 req/cdb-radar/attributes 

Dependency Rules defined on page 19 of this document. 

Test Test 
purpose 

Verify that each distinct RCS representation model has 
two different types of attributes: RCS model class 
attributes and RCS instance attributes.

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Test method Check values against rules defined on page 19. 

Test type  Conformance 

 

A.5 RCS Storage Files 

Test that a single RCS model in the CDB data store consists of the data files. 

• One *.shp main file that provides the geometric aspect (Points) for each data 
instance of a RCS model. 

• Two *.dbf files (one instance-level on a per RCS Shape basis, and one class-level 
at the RCS model level) that collectively provide the attribution for all of the 
possible RCS models of a given RCS Model. 

• One *.shx index file that stores the file offsets and content lengths for each of the 
records of the main *.shp file.  The only purpose of this file is to provide a simple 
means for clients to step through the individual records of the *.shp file (i.e., it 
contains no CDB modeled data). 
 

Conformance 5 /conf/core-radar/storage-files 

Requirement 5 req/cdb-radar/storage-files 

Dependency Shapefile specification 

Test Test 
purpose 

Verify that a single RCS model in the CDB data store 
consists of the data files: One *.shp, two *.dbf, and one 
*.shx 

Test method Visual inspection. 

Test type  Conformance 

 

A.6 RCS Storage Files 

Test that each variant of the RCS model in the Shapefile has a 10-character string 
attribute called “RCS_VARI”.  The string may contain the specific Radar model number 
(and possibly its frequency band L-Band, S-Band, X-Band, Ku-Band) for which this RCS 
variant applies to.  The suggested string convention for this field is as described in 
AN/APA to AN/APD - Equipment Listing. http://www.designation-
systems.net/usmilav/jetds/an-apa2apd.html#_APA.
