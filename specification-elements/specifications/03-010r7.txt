	 derivedCRSType
	 Type of a derived coordinate reference system. 
	 
		 engineering
		 A contextually local coordinate reference system; which can be divided into two broad categories:
- earth-fixed systems applied to engineering activities on or near the surface of the earth;
- CRSs on moving platforms such as road vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or spacecraft. 
	
	 
		 image
		 An engineering coordinate reference system applied to locations in images. 
	
	 
		 vertical
		 A coordinate reference system used for recording of heights or depths. Vertical CRSs make use of the direction of gravity to define the concept of height or depth, but the relationship with gravity may not be straightforward.

		 depth
		 The zero point of the vertical axis is defined by a surface that has meaning for the purpose which the associated vertical measurements are used for. For hydrographic charts, this is often a predicted nominal sea surface (i.e. without waves or other wind and current effects) that occurs at low tide. For some examples, see OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. 
	
	 
		 barometric
		 Atmospheric pressure is the basis for the definition of the origin of the associated vertical coordinate system axis. For more information, see OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. 
	
	 
		 other surface
		 In some cases, e.g. oil exploration and production, a geological feature, such as the top or bottom of a geologically identifiable and meaningful subsurface layer, is used as a vertical datum. Other variations to the above three vertical datum types may exist and are all included in this type.

        Some common reasons for a null value:   
			
        innapplicable - the object does not have a value
        missing - The correct value is not readily available to the sender of this data.  
                           Furthermore, a correct value may not exist.
        template - the value will be available later
        unknown - The correct value is not known to, and not computable by, the sender of this data.

       Name or code with an (optional) authority.  Text token.  
      If the codeSpace attribute is present, then its value should identify a dictionary, thesaurus 
      or authority for the term, such as the organisation who assigned the value, 
      or the dictionary from which it is taken.

       List of values on a uniform nominal scale.  List of text tokens.   
      In a list context a token should not include any spaces, so xsd:Name is used instead of xsd:string.  
      A member of the list may be a typed null.  
      If a codeSpace attribute is present, then its value is a reference to

       Tables or arrays of tuples.  
        May be used for text-encoding of values from a table.  
        Actually just a string, but allows the user to indicate which characters are used as separators.  
        The value of the 'cs' attribute is the separator for coordinate values, 
        and the value of the 'ts' attribute gives the tuple separator (a single space by default); 
        the default values may be changed to reflect local usage.
        Defaults to CSV within a tuple, space between tuples.  
        However, any string content will be schema-valid.  
    
     
       
         
         
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       Utility type used in various places 
      - e.g. to indicate the direction of topological objects;
      "+" for forwards, or "-" for backwards.

			 coordinateOperations.xsd
			 3.0
			 How to encode coordinate operation definitions. 
			 Builds on referenceSystems.xsd to encode the data needed to define coordinate operations, including Transformations, Conversions, and other specific subtypes of operations. Primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2003/05/21. 
			 Copyright (c) 2002-2003 OpenGIS, All Rights Reserved.
			 This schema encodes the Coordinate Operation (CC_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2. 
		
	
	
	 
	 
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 Basic encoding for coordinate operation objects, simplifying and restricting the DefinitionType as needed. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
					 
						 
							 Comments on or information about this coordinate operation, including source information. 
						
					
					 
				
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The name by which this coordinate operation is identified. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A mathematical operation on coordinates that transforms or converts coordinates to another coordinate reference system. Many but not all coordinate operations (from CRS A to CRS B) also uniquely define the inverse operation (from CRS B to CRS A). In some cases, the operation method algorithm for the inverse operation is the same as for the forward algorithm, but the signs of some operation parameter values must be reversed. In other cases, different algorithms are required for the forward and inverse operations, but the same operation parameter values are used. If (some) entirely different parameter values are needed, a different coordinate operation shall be defined.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
					 
					 
					 
					 
						 
							 Estimate of the impact of this coordinate operation on point position accuracy. Gives position error estimates for target coordinates of this coordinate operation, assuming no errors in source coordinates. 
						
					
					 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 An identification of this coordinate operation. The first coordinateOperationID, if any, is normally the primary identification code, and any others are aliases. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Version of the coordinate transformation (i.e., instantiation due to the stochastic nature of the parameters). Mandatory when describing a transformation, and should not be supplied for a conversion. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Association to the source CRS (coordinate reference system) of this coordinate operation. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Association to the target CRS (coordinate reference system) of this coordinate operation. For constraints on multiplicity of "sourceCRS" and "targetCRS", see UML model of Coordinate Operation package in OGC Abstract Specification topic 2. 
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 Association to a coordinate operation, either referencing or containing the definition of that coordinate operation. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 An ordered sequence of two or more single coordinate operations. The sequence of operations is constrained by the requirement that the source coordinate reference system of step (n+1) must be the same as the target coordinate reference system of step (n). The source coordinate reference system of the first step and the target coordinate reference system of the last step are the source and target coordinate reference system associated with the concatenated operation. Instead of a forward operation, an inverse operation may be used for one or more of the operation steps mentioned above, if the inverse operation is uniquely defined by the forward operation.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Ordered sequence of associations to the two or more single operations used by this concatenated operation. 
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 Association to a concatenated operation, either referencing or containing the definition of that concatenated operation. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A single (not concatenated) coordinate operation.

			 Ordered sequence of positive integers defining the positions in a coordinate tuple of the coordinates affected by this pass-through operation. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Association to the operation applied to the specified ordinates. 
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 Association to a pass through operation, either referencing or containing the definition of that pass through operation. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 A parameterized mathematical operation on coordinates that transforms or converts coordinates to another coordinate reference system. This coordinate operation uses an operation method, usually with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameters are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type.

This abstract complexType shall not be directly used, extended, or restricted in a compliant Application Schema.

			 An abstract operation on coordinates that does not include any change of datum. The best-known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.

This abstract complexType is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Conversion instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized element names and contents. This conversion uses an operation method, usually with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameters are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references the "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include zero or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "_generalParameterValue" element.

			 A concrete operation on coordinates that does not include any change of Datum. The best-known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.

This concrete complexType can be used with all operation methods, without using an Application Schema that defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents. This abstract complexType can also be used, extended, or restricted for well-known operation methods, especially for methods with only one Conversion instance.

			 Association to a concrete general-purpose conversion, either referencing or containing the definition of that conversion. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 An abstract operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of Datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation.

This abstract complexType is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Transformation instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized value element names and contents. This transformation uses an operation method with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameter values are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references one "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include one or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "_generalParameterValue" element.

			 A parameter value or group of parameter values.
			
This abstract complexType is expected to be extended and restricted for well-known operation methods with many instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized element names and contents. Specific parameter value elements are directly contained in concrete subtypes, not in this abstract type.

			 This schema encodes the Coordinate Reference System (SC_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates, with the exception of the abstract "SC_CRS" class. The "SC_CRS" class is encoded in referenceSystems.xsd, to eliminate the (circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd.

			 A coordinate reference system consists of an ordered sequence of coordinate system axes that are related to the earth through a datum. A coordinate reference system is defined by one datum and by one coordinate system. Most coordinate reference system do not move relative to the earth, except for engineering coordinate reference systems defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. For further information, see OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2.

Coordinate reference systems are commonly divided into sub-types. The common classification criterion for sub-typing of coordinate reference systems is the way in which they deal with earth curvature. This has a direct effect on the portion of the earth's surface that can be covered by that type of CRS with an acceptable degree of error. The exception to the rule is the subtype "Temporal" which has been added by analogy.

			 How to encode datum definitions. 
			 Builds on referenceSystems.xsd to encode the data needed to define datums, including the specific subtypes of datums. Primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2003/05/21. 
			 Copyright (c) 2002-2003 Open GIS Consortium, All Rights Reserved.
			 This schema encodes the Datum (CD_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2.

			 The name by which this datum is identified. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth, thus creating a coordinate reference system. A datum uses a parameter or set of parameters that determine the location of the origin, the orientation, and the scale of a coordinate reference system. This abstract complexType shall not be used, extended, or restricted, in an Application Schema, to define a concrete subtype with a meaning equivalent to a concrete subtype specified in this document. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
					 
					 
					 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 An identification of a datum. The first datumID, if any, is normally the primary identification code, and any others are aliases. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Description, possibly including coordinates, of the point or points used to anchor the datum to the Earth. Also known as the "origin", especially for engineering and image datums. The codeSpace attribute can be used to reference a source of more detailed on this point or surface, or on a set of such descriptions. 
- For a geodetic datum, this point is also known as the fundamental point, which is traditionally the point where the relationship between geoid and ellipsoid is defined. In some cases, the "fundamental point" may consist of a number of points. In those cases, the parameters defining the geoid/ellipsoid relationship have been averaged for these points, and the averages adopted as the datum definition.
- For an engineering datum, the anchor point may be a physical point, or it may be a point with defined coordinates in another CRS.
- For an image datum, the anchor point is usually either the centre of the image or the corner of the image.
- For a temporal datum, this attribute is not defined. Instead of the anchor point, a temporal datum carries a separate time origin of type DateTime. 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 The time for which this datum definition is valid. This time may be precise (e.g. 1997.0 for IRTF97) or merely a year (e.g. 1983 for NAD83). In the latter case, the epoch usually refers to the year in which a major recalculation of the geodetic control network, underlying the datum, was executed or initiated.

			 Definition of the second parameter that defines the shape of an ellipsoid. An ellipsoid requires two defining parameters: semi-major axis and inverse flattening or semi-major axis and semi-minor axis. When the reference body is a sphere rather than an ellipsoid, only a single defining parameter is required, namely the radius of the sphere; in that case, the semi-major axis "degenerates" into the radius of the sphere.

			Dictionary schema for GML 3.0 
			Components to support the lists of definitions.  
    
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
     
       A definition, which can be included in or referenced by a dictionary. In this extended type, the inherited "description" optional element can hold the definition whenever only text is needed. The inherited "name" elements can provide one or more brief terms for which this is the definition. The inherited "metaDataProperty" elements can be used to reference or include more information about this definition.  
The gml:id attribute is required - it must be possible to reference this definition using this handle.  
    
     
       
         
           
           
           
        
         
      
    
  
  
   
   
  
   
     
       A non-abstract bag that is specialized for use as a dictionary which contains a set of definitions. These definitions are referenced from other places, in the same and different XML documents. In this restricted type, the inherited optional "description" element can be used for a description of this dictionary. The inherited optional "name" element can be used for the name(s) of this dictionary. The inherited "metaDataProperty" elements can be used to reference or contain more information about this dictionary. The inherited required gml:id attribute allows the dictionary to be referenced using this handle. 
    
     
       
         
           
             
               An entry in this dictionary. The content of an entry can itself be a lower level dictionary or definition collection. This element follows the standard GML property model, so the value may be provided directly or by reference. Note that if the value is provided by reference, this definition does not carry a handle (gml:id) in this context, so does not allow external references to this specific entry in this context. When used in this way the referenced definition will usually be in a dictionary in the same XML document. 
            
          
           
             
               An identified reference to a remote entry in this dictionary, to be used when this entry should be identified to allow external references to this specific entry. 
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
   
   
  
   
     
       An entry in a dictionary of definitions. An instance of this type contains or refers to a definition object.  

The number of definitions contained in this dictionaryEntry is restricted to one, but a DefinitionCollection or Dictionary that contains multiple definitions can be substituted if needed. Specialized descendents of this dictionaryEntry might be restricted in an application schema to allow only including specified types of definitions as valid entries in a dictionary. 
    
     
       
         
           This element in a dictionary entry contains the actual definition. 
        
      
    
     
       
         A non-identified reference to a remote entry in this dictionary, to be used when this entry need not be identified to allow external references to this specific entry. The remote entry referenced will usually be in a dictionary in the same XML document. This element will usually be used in dictionaries that are inside of another dictionary. 
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       An entry in a dictionary of definitions that contains a GML object which references a remote definition object. This entry is expected to be convenient in allowing multiple elements in one XML document to contain short (abbreviated XPointer) references, which are resolved to an external definition provided in a Dictionary element in the same XML document. Specialized descendents of this dictionaryEntry might be restricted in an application schema to allow only including specified types of definitions as valid entries in a dictionary. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       A proxy entry in a dictionary of definitions. An element of this type contains a reference to a remote definition object. This entry is expected to be convenient in allowing multiple elements in one XML document to contain short (abbreviated XPointer) references, which are resolved to an external definition provided in a Dictionary element in the same XML document. 
    
     
       
         
           
             
               A reference to a remote entry in this dictionary, used when this dictionary entry is identified to allow external references to this specific entry. The remote entry referenced can be in a dictionary in the same or different XML document.

       This includes not only measures.xsd, but also units.xsd, gmlBase.xsd and basicTypes.xsd.
    
  
  
  
  
   
     
       The "_Geometry" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all geometry elements of GML 3. This includes pre-defined and user-defined geometry elements. Any geometry element must be a direct or indirect extension/restriction of AbstractGeometryType and must be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of "_Geometry".
    
  
  
   
     
       All geometry elements are derived directly or indirectly from this abstract supertype. A geometry element may have an identifying attribute ("gml:id"), a name (attribute "name") and a description (attribute "description"). It may be associated with a spatial reference system (attribute "srsName"). The following rules shall be adhered: - Every geometry type shall derive from this abstract type. - Every geometry element (i.e. an element of a geometry type) shall be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of _Geometry.
    
     
       
         
           
             This attribute is included for backward compatibility with GML 2 and is deprecated with GML 3. This identifer is superceded by "gml:id" inherited from AbstractGMLType. The attribute "gid" should not be used anymore and may be deleted in future versions of GML without further notice.
          
        
         
           
             In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to (Note: These "WKCRS"-ids still have to be specified).  If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS must be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, e.g. a geometric aggregate.
          
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       A geometric property can either be any geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document). Note that either the reference or the contained element must be given, but not both or none.
    
     
       
    
     
       
         This attribute group includes the XLink attributes (see xlinks.xsd). XLink is used in GML to reference remote resources (including those elsewhere in the same document). A simple link element can be constructed by including a specific set of XLink attributes. The XML Linking Language (XLink) is currently a Proposed Recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium. XLink allows elements to be inserted into XML documents so as to create sophisticated links between resources; such links can be used to reference remote properties. A simple link element can be used to implement pointer functionality, and this functionality has been built into various GML 3 elements by including the gml:AssociationAttributeGroup.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       A container for an array of geometry elements. The elements are always contained in the array property, referencing geometry elements or arrays of geometry elements is not supported.
    
     
       
    
  
  
  
   
     
       The "_GeometricPrimitive" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all (pre- and user-defined) geometric primitives.
    
  
  
   
     
       This is the abstract root type of the geometric primitives. A geometric primitive is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. All primitives are oriented in the direction implied by the sequence of their coordinate tuples.
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       A property that has a geometric primitive as its value domain can either be an appropriate geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document). Either the reference or the contained element must be given, but neither both nor none.
    
     
       
    
     
       
         This attribute group includes the XLink attributes (see xlinks.xsd). XLink is used in GML to reference remote resources (including those elsewhere in the same document).

       A Point is defined by a single coordinate tuple.
    
     
       
         
           
             
               GML supports two different ways to specify the direct poisiton of a point. 1. The "pos" element is of type DirectPositionType. 2. The "coordinates" element is of type CoordinatesType. The number of direct positions in the coordinates list must be one.
            
             
             
             
               
                 Deprecated with GML version 3.0. Use "pos" instead. The "coord" element is included for backwards compatibility with GML 2.
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
         
           
             
          
        
      
       This property element either references a point via the XLink-attributes or contains the point element. pointProperty is the predefined property which can be used by GML Application Schemas whenever a GML Feature has a property with a value that is substitutable for Point.
    
  
  
   
     
       A property that has a point as its value domain can either be an appropriate geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document). Either the reference or the contained element must be given, but neither both nor none.

       The "_Curve" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all (continuous) curve elements.
    
  
  
   
     
       An abstraction of a curve to support the different levels of complexity. The curve can always be viewed as a geometric primitive, i.e. is continuous.
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       
         
           
             
          
        
      
       This property element either references a curve via the XLink-attributes or contains the curve element. curveProperty is the predefined property which can be used by GML Application Schemas whenever a GML Feature has a property with a value that is substitutable for _Curve.
    
  
  
   
     
       A property that has a curve as its value domain can either be an appropriate geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document).

        				A LineString is a special curve that consists of a single segment with linear interpolation. It is defined by two or more coordinate tuples, with linear interpolation between them.

               GML supports two different ways to specify the control points of a line string. 1. A sequence of "pos" (DirectPositionType) or "pointRep" (PointPropertyType) elements. "pos" elements are control points that are only part of this curve, "pointRep" elements contain a point that may be referenced from other geometry elements or reference another point defined outside of this curve (reuse of existing points). 2. The "coordinates" element allows for a compact way to specifiy the coordinates of the control points, if all control points are in the same coordinate reference systems and belong to this curve only. The number of direct positions in the coordinates list must be at least two.
            
             
               
               
               
                 
                   Deprecated with GML version 3.0. Use "pos" instead. The "coord" element is included for backwards compatibility with GML 2.
                
              
            
             
          
        
      
    
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
     
       DirectPosition instances hold the coordinates for a position within some coordinate reference system (CRS). Since DirectPositions, as data types, will often be included in larger objects (such as geometry elements) that have references to CRS, the "srsName" attribute will in general be missing, if this particular DirectPosition is included in a larger element with such a reference to a CRS. In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on the value of the containing object's CRS.
    
     
       
         
           
             In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to (Note: These "WKCRS"-ids still have to be specified).  If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS must be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, e.g. a geometric element like point, curve, etc. It is expected that the attribute will be specified at the direct position level only in rare cases.
          
        
         
           
             The attribute "dimension" is the length of coordinate sequence (the number of entries in the list). This is determined by the coordinate reference system.
          
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       A Vector is an ordered set of numbers called coordinates that represent a position in a coordinate reference system (CRS). For some application the components of the position may be adjusted to yield a unit vector.

       A non-abstract generic collection type that can be used as a document element for a collection of any GML types - Geometries, Topologies, Features ...

“FeatureCollections” may only contain Features.  “GeometryCollections” may only contain Geometry’s.  “Bags” are less constrained – they must contain objects that are substitutable for gml:_Object.  This may mix several levels, including Features, Definitions, Dictionaries, Geometries etc.  

The content model would ideally be 
   member 0..*
   members 0..1
   member 0..*
for maximum flexibility in building a collection from both homogeneous and distinct components: 
included "member" elements each contain a single Object
an included "members" element contains a set of Objects 

However, this is non-deterministic, thus prohibited by XSD.

         A pattern or base for derived types used to specify complex types corresponding to an  unspecified UML association - either composition or aggregation.  Restricts the cardinality of Objects contained in the association to a maximum of one.  An instance of this type can contain an element representing an Object, or serve as a pointer to a remote Object.  

Descendents of this type can be restricted in an application schema to 
* allow only specified classes as valid participants in the aggregation
* allow only association by reference (i.e. empty the content model) or by value (i.e. remove the xlinks).    

When used for association by reference, the value of the gml:remoteSchema attribute can be used to locate a schema fragment that constrains the target instance.   

In many cases it is desirable to impose the constraint prohibiting the occurence of both reference and value in the same instance, as that would be ambiguous.  This is accomplished by adding a directive in the annotation element of the element declaration.  This directive can be in the form of normative prose, or can use a Schematron pattern to automatically constrain co-occurrence - see the declaration for _strictAssociation below.   

If co-occurence is not prohibited, then both a link and content may be present.  If this occurs in an instance, then the rule for interpretation is that the instance found by traversing the href provides the normative value of the property, and should be used when possible.  The value(s) included as content may be used if the remote instance cannot be resolved.  This may be considered to be a "cached" version of the value(s).

         A base for derived types used to specify complex types containing an array of objects, by unspecified UML association - either composition or aggregation.  An instance of this type contains elements representing Objects.

Ideally this type would be derived by extension of AssociationType.  
However, this leads to a non-deterministic content model, since both the base and the extension have minOccurs="0", and is thus prohibited in XML Schema.

       Database handle for the object.  It is of XML type “ID”, so is constrained to be unique in the XML document within which it occurs.  An external identifier for the object in the form of a URI may be constructed using standard XML and XPointer methods.  This is done by concatenating the URI for the document, a fragment separator “#”, and the value of the id attribute.  
    
  
  
   
     
       Reference to an XML Schema fragment that specifies the content model of the property’s value. This is in conformance with the XML Schema Section 4.14 Referencing Schemas from Elsewhere. 
    
  
  
   
     
       Attribute group used to enable property elements to refer to their value remotely. It contains the “simple link” components from xlinks.xsd, with all members “optional”, and the remoteSchema attribute, which is also optional.  These attributes can be attached to any element, thus allowing it to act as a pointer. The 'remoteSchema' attribute allows an element  that carries link attributes to indicate that the element is declared  in a remote schema rather than by the schema that constrains the current document instance. 
    
     
     
  
  
   
     
       Identifier for the object, normally a descriptive name. An object may have several names, typically assigned by different authorities.  The authority for a name is indicated by the value of its (optional) codeSpace attribute.  The name may or may not be unique, as determined by the rules of the organization responsible for the codeSpace. 
    
  
  
   
     
       Contains a simple text description of the object, or refers to an external description.  
    
  
  
   
     
       
This type is available wherever there is a need for a "text" type property. It is of string type, so the text can be included inline, but the value can also be referenced remotely via xlinks from the AssociationAttributeGroup. If the remote reference is present, then the value obtained by traversing the link should be used, and the string content of the element can be used for an annotation.

Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for length along the axes of a grid, such as pixel spacings or grid spacings. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       Value of a spatial area quantity, with its units. Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for an area, such as square metres or square miles. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       Value of a spatial volume quantity, with its units. Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for a volume, such as cubic metres or cubic feet. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       Value of a velocity, with its units. Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for a velocity, such as metres per second or miles per hour. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       Value of an angle quantity provided in either degree-minute-second format or single value format. 
    
     
       
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Value of an angle quantity recorded as a single number, with its units. Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for an angle, such as degrees or radians. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Angle value provided in degree-minute-second or degree-minute format. 
    
     
       
       
         
         
           
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Integer number of degrees, plus the angle direction. This element can be used for geographic Latitude and Longitude. For Latitude, the XML attribute direction can take the values "N" or "S", meaning North or South of the equator. For Longitude, direction can take the values "E" or "W", meaning East or West of the prime meridian. This element can also be used for other angles. In that case, the direction can take the values "+" or "-" (of SignType), in the specified rotational direction from a specified reference direction. 
    
     
       
         
           
             
               
                 
                   
                   
                   
                   
                
              
               
                 
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       Integer number of degrees in a degree-minute-second or degree-minute angular value, without indication of direction. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Decimal number of arc-minutes in a degree-minute angular value. 
    
     
       
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Integer number of arc-minutes in a degree-minute-second angular value. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Number of arc-seconds in a degree-minute-second angular value.

			 How to encode reference system definitions. 
			 Builds on several other parts of GML 3 to encode the data needed to define reference systems. Primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2003/05/21. 
			 Copyright (c) 2002-2003 Open GIS Consortium, All Rights Reserved.
			 This schema encodes the Reference System (RS_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2. The SC_CRS class is also encoded here, to eliminate the (circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. The RS_SpatialReferenceSystemUsingGeographicIdentifier class is not encoded, since it is not applicable to coordinate positions. The CI_Citation class is not directly encoded, since such information can be included as metaDataProperty elements which are optionally allowed. A modified version of the EX_Extent (DataType) class from ISO 19115 is currently encoded here, using GML 3 schema types. (A more extensive version of the EX_Extent package might be XML encoded in the future, probably in a separate extent.xsd schema.)

    The temporal schema for GML 3.0 provides constructs for handling time-varying spatial 
    data. This schema reflects a partial yet consistent implementation of the model described 
    in ISO 19108 (topological complexes and feature succession are not included).

      This abstract element acts as the head of the substitution group for temporal primitives and complexes.  
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
       A temporal object must be associated with a temporal reference system via URI. 
       The Gregorian calendar with UTC is the default reference system, following ISO 
       8601. Other reference systems in common use include the GPS calendar and the 
       Julian calendar.

      This abstract element serves as the head of the substitution group for elements used 
      to indicate temporal length or distance (duration, interval). 
     
    
  
  
   
     
       
      Base type for describing temporal length or distance. The value space is further 
      constrained by subtypes that conform to the ISO 8601 or ISO 11404 standards.
      
    
     
  
  
   
     
       
      This element is an instance of the primitive xsd:duration simple type to 
      enable use of the ISO 8601 syntax for temporal length (e.g. P5DT4H30M). 
      It is a valid subtype of TimeDurationType according to section 3.14.6, 
      rule 2.2.4 in XML Schema, Part 1.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      Here we have collapsed the hierarchy of subtypes for temporal position in 19108 
      by defining a union of simple types for indicating temporal position relative to a 
      specific reference system. 
      Date and time may be indicated with varying degrees of precision:
      year, year-month, date, or dateTime (all ISO 8601 format). Note 
      that the dateTime type does not allow right-truncation (i.e. omitting 
      seconds). An ordinal era may be referenced via URI, and a decimal value
      can be used to indicate the distance from the scale origin (e.g. UNIX time,  
      GPS calendar).
      
    
     
  
  
   
     
       Direct representation of a temporal position. 
    
  
  
   
     
       
      Indeterminate time values are also allowed, as described in ISO 19108. The indeterminatePosition 
      attribute can be used alone or it can qualify a specific value for temporal position (e.g. before 
      2002-12, after 1019624400). For time values that identify position within a calendar, the 
      calendarEraName attribute provides the name of the calendar era to which the date is 
      referenced (e.g. the Meiji era of the Japanese calendar).
      
    
     
       
         
         
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
        This enumerated data type specifies values for indeterminate positions.
      
    
     
       
       
       
       
    
  
  
   
     
       
			This element is a valid subtype of TimeDurationType according to section 3.14.6, 
			rule 2.2.4 in XML Schema, Part 1.
			
    
  
  
   
     
       
      This type extends the built-in xsd:decimal simple type to allow floating-point 
      values for temporal length. According to  the ISO 11404 model you have to use 
      positiveInteger together with appropriate values for radix and factor. The 
      resolution of the time interval is to one radix ^(-factor) of the specified 
      time unit (e.g. unit="second", radix="10", factor="3" specifices a resolution 
      of milliseconds). It is a subtype of TimeDurationType.
      
    
     
       
         
         
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
        This enumerated data type indicates standard units for measuring time.
      
    
     
       
       
       
       
       
       
    
  
  
   
   
  
   
     
       
        A timestamp property associates an element with a temporal primitive.
      
    
     
       
    
     
  
  
   
  
   
     
       
        A value in the time domain is measured relative to a temporal reference system. Common 
        types of reference systems include calendars, ordinal temporal reference systems, and 
        temporal coordinate systems (time elapsed since some epoch, e.g. UNIX time).
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       
      A temporal coordinate system is based on a continuous interval scale defined in terms of a single time interval.
      
    
     
       
         
           
           
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       
      In an ordinal reference system the order of events in time can be well 
      established, but the magnitude of the intervals between them can not be 
      accurately determined (e.g. a stratigraphic sequence).
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       
      Ordinal temporal reference systems are often hierarchically structured 
      such that an ordinal era at a given level of the hierarchy includes a 
      sequence of shorter, coterminous ordinal eras.

       How to encode units of measure (or uom) for numerical values. 
       Builds on gmlBase.xsd to encode units of measure (or uom), including definitions of units of measure and dictionaries of such definitions. GML 3.0 candidate schema, primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2002/11/13. 
       Copyright (c) 2001-2002 OpenGIS, All Rights Reserved.
       Parts of this schema are based on Subclause 6.5.7 of ISO/CD 19103 Geographic information - Conceptual schema language, on Subclause A.5.2.2.3 of ISO/CD 19118 Geographic information - Encoding, and on most of OpenGIS Recommendation Paper OGC 02-007r4 Units of Measure Use and Definition Recommendations. 
    
  
  
   
  
   
  
   
     
       Reference to a unit of measure definition that applies to all the numerical values described by the element containing this element. Notice that a complexType which needs to include the uom attribute can do so by extending this complexType. Alternately, this complexType can be used as a pattern for a new complexType. 
    
     
     
       
         Reference to a unit of measure definition, usually within the same XML document but possibly outside the XML document which contains this reference. For a reference within the same XML document, the "#" symbol should be used, followed by a text abbreviation of the unit name. However, the "#" symbol may be optional, and still may be interpreted as a reference. 
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of a unit of measure (or uom). The definition includes a quantityType property, which indicates the phenomenon to which the units apply, and a catalogSymbol, which gives the short symbol used for this unit. This element is used when the relationship of this unit to other units or units systems is unknown.
    
     
       
         
           
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of a unit of measure which is a base unit from the system of units.  A base unit cannot be derived by combination of other base units within this system.  Sometimes known as "fundamental unit".  
    
     
       
         
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of a unit of measure which is defined through algebraic combination of more primitive units, which are usually base units from a particular system of units. Derived units based directly on base units are usually preferred for quantities other than the base units or fundamental quantities within a system.  If a derived unit is not the preferred unit, the ConventionalUnit element should be used instead.  
    
     
       
         
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of a unit of measure which is related to a preferred unit for this quantity type through a conversion formula.  A method for deriving this unit by algebraic combination of more primitive units, may also be provided.  
    
     
       
         
           
             
             
          
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       Informal description of the phenomenon or type of quantity that is measured or observed. For example, "length", "angle", "time", "pressure", or "temperature". When the quantity is the result of an observation or measurement, this term is known as Observable Type or Measurand. 
    
  
  
   
     
       For global understanding of a unit of measure, it is often possible to reference an item in a catalog of units, using a symbol in that catalog. The "codeSpace" attribute in "CodeType" identifies a namespace for the catalog symbol value, and might reference the catalog. The "string" value in "CodeType" contains the value of a symbol that is unique within this catalog namespace. This symbol often appears explicitly in the catalog, but it could be a combination of symbols using a specified algebra of units. For example, the symbol "cm" might indicate that it is the "m" symbol combined with the "c" prefix. 
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of the relationship of a derived unit of measure to the primitive units to which that unit is related. Contains a set of one or more UnitTerms which are combined as a product, each of which references a unit of measure defined elsewhere, and has an exponent. 
    
     
       
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Definition of one unit term for a derived unit of measure. This unit term references another unit of measure (uom) and provides an integer exponent applied to that unit in defining the compound unit. The exponent can be positive or negative, but not zero. 
    
     
       
         
      
    
  
  
   
     
       This element is included when this unit has an accurate conversion to the preferred unit for this quantity type. 
    
  
  
   
     
       This element is included when the correct definition of this unit is unknown, but this unit has a rough or inaccurate conversion to the preferred unit for this quantity type. 
    
  
  
   
     
       Relation of a unit to the preferred unit for this quantity type, specified by an arithmetic conversion (scaling and/or offset). A preferred unit is either a base unit or a derived unit selected for all units of one quantity type. The mandatory attribute "uom" shall reference the preferred unit that this conversion applies to. The conversion is specified by one of two alternative elements: "factor" or "formula". 
    
     
       
         
           
           
        
      
    
  
  
   
     
       Specification of the scale factor by which a value using this unit of measure can be multiplied to obtain the corresponding value using the preferred unit of measure. 
    
  
  
   
  
   
     
       Paremeters of a simple formula by which a value using this unit of measure can be converted to the corresponding value using the preferred unit of measure. The formula element contains elements a, b, c and d, whose values use the XML Schema type "double". These values are used in the formula y = (a + bx) / (c + dx), where x is a value using this unit, and y is the corresponding value using the preferred unit. The elements a and d are optional, and if values are not provided, those parameters are considered to be zero. If values are not provided for both a and d, the formula is equivalent to a fraction with numerator and denominator parameters.

	 This operation method implements the universal image geometry model that transforms ground coordinates into georeferenced image coordinates. This image geometry model uses one ratio of two polynomial functions to compute the row image coordinate, and uses a similar ratio of two different polynomials to compute the column image coordinate. All four polynomials are functions of three ground coordinates: two horizontal coordinates and one vertical coordinate. In the polynomial functions, the three ground coordinates and two image coordinates are each offset and scaled to have a range from -1.0 to +1.0 over an image or image section. For brevity, this simplified operation method specification does not include all geometry model parameters or all optional XML elements.

i. Preface


This OpenGIS© Recommendation Paper specifies basic XML encoding of data defining coordinate reference systems and coordinate operations. This encoding is expected to be adapted and used by multiple OGC Implementation Specifications, by the separate specification of Application Schemas. This document is a Recommendation Paper because the specified encoding is more general than an OpenGIS Implementation Specification and more specific than the OpenGIS Abstract Specification.


NOTE 1
This document does not specify all the things needed to ensure interoperability between different implementations of software using these CRS Schemas. Some of the additional things that should be specified to ensure interoperability are listed in Clause iv: Future work. These things may be specified in a separate OGC specification, or perhaps added in a revised version of this document. The CRS WG intends to do this work as soon as practical. 


This Recommendation Paper replaces OpenGIS Recommendation Paper 01-014r5, titled "Recommended Definition Data for Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations". The key changes in this revised Recommendation Paper are:


a) Use XML schemas to specify the XML encoding, instead of using XML DTDs.


b) Derive the recommended XML schemas by encoding the UML model in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2 "Spatial Referencing by Coordinates".

NOTE 2
The revised UML model for Topic 2 is contained in document 03-009r6. That model is supplemented by the UML model of the EX_Extent class in ISO/FDIS 19115.


c) Derive the XML schemas by adapting the XML encoding rules described in Subclause A.5 of the N1316 draft of ISO 19118 "Geographic information - Encoding".

NOTE 3
Document N1316 is supplemented by XML Schema documents posted on David Skogan’s web page on ISO 19118 encoding: http://www.ifi.uio.no/~davids/encoding.

d) Build upon central parts of the GML 3.0 XML schemas, using some GML 3.0 schema documents and most GML 3 encoding patterns.


NOTE 4
Many of the GML 3 schema patterns are described in Subclauses 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 through 8.3, and 8.6 of the GML 3.00 Implementation Specification.


Many key contents of this document are also provided in the attached set of files, in the file 03-010r7a.zip. These files include the six XML Schema documents (.xsd files) specifying the recommended XML encoding of coordinate reference system (CRS) and coordinate operation definition data. These six files are named referenceSystems.xsd, coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, datums.xsd, coordinateSystems.xsd, coordinateOperations.xsd, and dataQuality.xsd. The attached files also include:


e) Current versions of the nine XML Schema documents from GML 3.0 that are used by these CRS schemas, and are needed to validate these CRS Schemas.


f) The example XML documents and corresponding XML Schema for Annex D "Standard contents of code lists".


g) The example XML documents for Annex E "XML document examples".


h) The example Application Schemas and XML documents for Annex F "Example application schemas".

iii. Changes to the OpenGIS( Abstract Specification


The OpenGIS Abstract Specification Topic 2 "Spatial Referencing by Coordinates" should be changed to use the revised UML model proposed in OGC 03-009r6.


iv. Future work


Improvements of this document are needed to:


i) Modify XML schemas to reflect any further changes in UML model (see further work clause in document 03-009r6)


j) Resolve question if too much flexibility is provided in coordinateOperations.xsd (at the expense of interoperability)


k) Specify how to reference items in the EPSG and other well-known data bases of CRS-related definition data (tentatively using URNs)


l) Specify standard XML encodings of some well-known operation methods, coordinate operations, CRSs, units, etc., and specify how to reference these standard XML documents (perhaps using URLs)


m) Specify how to reference items in customized repositories or catalogs of CRS definition data (perhaps used by specific OGC Implementation Specifications)


NOTE 
The last three items listed above are clearly needed to support interoperability (see Note 1 in Clause i.). The CRS WG intends to do this work as soon as practical. These items may be specified in a separate OGC specification, or perhaps added in a revised version of this document.


v. Background


The Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) Working Group (formerly the Coordinate Transformation Working Group) has been developing XML Schemas specifying XML encoding of Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and Coordinate Transformation (CT) definition data. Those schemas were previously being developed largely without directly using any UML model, and largely by converting to XML Schemas the XML DTD specified in OGC Recommendation Paper 01-014r5: Recommended Definition Data for Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations.

The N1316 draft of ISO 19118 requires XML encoding of geospatial data to be developed by converting a UML model of the data to be encoded into the corresponding XML schemas. This conversion must be done in a largely mechanical fashion, using a set of UML to XML Schema conversion rules. Subclause A.5 of the N1316 specifies a draft set of UML to XML schema conversion rules, but explicitly allows variations of those rules to be used, if those variations are documented.


Some prospective users of OGC-specified XML encoding strongly desire that all such XML encoding specifications be compliant with ISO 19118. The XML schemas previously being developed by the CRS WG were not compliant with ISO 19118, partially because they did not convert a UML model to XML schemas. In particular, that draft encoding did not directly convert the UML model developed for Topic 2 of the OGC Abstract Specification.


This revised Recommendation Paper improves the relevant XML work previously done by the Open GIS Consortium (OGC). The OpenGIS-accepted CT Implementation Specification already specifies a XML DTD for CRSs and CTs. The now-superseded GML 1 Recommendation Paper included an informative annex that specified a XML DTD for CRSs, including some CTs. These two XML DTDs are significantly different, and both appear to be incomplete.


Foreword


This OpenGIS© Recommendation Paper replaces previous Recommendation Paper numbered 01-014r5 and titled "Recommended Definition Data for Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations".


This document is heavily based on OpenGIS© Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates, which is partially based on ISO 19111. This document uses XML Schemas as specified by the W3C. This document is also partially based on ISO 19118, and on version 3.00 of the Geography Markup Language (GML) Implementation Specification.


This document contains nine annexes. Annexes A and C are normative, and all the others are informative.


Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The Open GIS Consortium Inc. shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.


Introduction


This document specifies a standard XML encoding for data defining Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations, specified using XML Schemas. This CRS and coordinate operation definition data will often be transferred between client and server software that implements various standardised interfaces and data formats. This specified general definition data encoding is intended for use in multiple OGC Implementation Specifications. That is, each of these specifications is expected to use a subset and/or superset of this standard definition data, by specifying and using Application Schemas that build on these XML Schemas.


The position or location of a point can be described using coordinates. Such coordinates are unambiguous only when the coordinate reference system on which those coordinates are based is fully defined. Each position is described by a set of coordinates based on a specified coordinate reference system. Coordinates are often used in datasets in which all coordinates belong to the same coordinate reference system. This paper specifies XML encoding of data defining coordinate reference systems for point coordinates.


The same point position will usually have different coordinates in different coordinate reference systems. There are a large number of different coordinate reference systems in current use. Coordinates from different datasets will thus often have different coordinate reference systems. In order to use together positions from different coordinate reference systems, known point coordinates often must be transformed into the corresponding coordinates in a different coordinate reference system. This paper specifies XML encoding of data defining such coordinate transformations

Recommended XML encoding of coordinate reference system definitions

1 Scope


This OpenGIS© standard specifies standard XML encodings of definition data for Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations, specified using XML Schemas. This encoding is intended for use when transferring such definition data between client and server software that uses OpenGIS standard interfaces, as specified in other documents. The expected uses of this definition data transfer include those described in Annex B (informative).


Definition data encoding is specified herein for multiple types of CRSs, including:


a) Geocentric coordinate reference systems


b) Geographic coordinate reference systems


c) Projected coordinate reference systems


d) Engineering coordinate reference systems


e) Vertical coordinate reference systems


f) Temporal coordinate reference systems


g) Image coordinate reference systems


h) Derived coordinate reference systems


i) Compound coordinate reference systems, combining two or more other coordinate reference systems


Definition data encoding is also specified herein for multiple types of coordinate operations, including:


a) Parameterized coordinate transformations and conversions


b) Concatenated coordinate transformations, combining two or more coordinate transformations


c) Pass-through coordinate transformations, using another coordinate transformation


The current scope of this encoding does not include:


a) Vertical coordinate reference systems with time units


b) Specific well-known coordinate conversions and transformations


This OpenGIS standard specifies standard XML encoding of CRS and coordinate operation definition data applicable to multiple separate OpenGIS interface Implementation Specifications. Each such Implementation Specification should specify one or more subsets and/or supersets of the definition data specified herein, each to be used for one or more purposes. That is, for each type of XML document used, the Implementation Specification should specify one or more Application Schemas that are similar to the Application Schemas required to use GML.


Those OpenGIS standard interfaces are implemented by service software that performs functions for separate client software. Those Implementation Specifications, or profiles of those Implementation Specifications, can use any Distributed Computing Platform (DCP). CRS and/or coordinate operation definition data will often be transferred encoded in XML documents. However, other encodings can be used, such as Well Known Text (WKT).


2 Conformance


Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative). The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance, are specified in ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing.

 — UML notation


In these UML class diagrams, the class boxes with three compartments and a light background are the primary classes being shown in this diagram, often the classes from one UML package. The class boxes without compartments and with a gray background are other classes used by these primary classes, usually classes from other packages.


In this specification, the following four stereotypes of UML classes are used:


a) <<Abstract>> A polymorphic object class that cannot be instantiated.

b) <<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information.


c) <<CodeList>> A flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential values.


d) <<Union>> Contains a list of attributes where only one of those attributes can be present at any time.


In this specification, the following standard data types are used:


a) String – A sequence of characters


b) Integer – An integer number


c) Double – A double precision floating point number


d) Boolean – A value specifying TRUE or FALSE

5.3 Document terms and definitions


The following specification terms and definitions are used in this document:


n) shall – verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this specification, from which no deviation is permitted


o) should – verb form used to indicate desirable ability or use, without mentioning or excluding other possibilities


p) may – verb form used to indicate an action permissible within the limits of this specification


q) can – verb form used for statements of possibility


r) informative – a part of a document that is provided for explanation, but is not required

s) normative – a part of a standards document that is required


t) annex – an auxiliary part of a document, called an “appendix” in United States English


u) clause – a major part of a document, called a “section” or “paragraph” in United States English


v) subclause – a secondary part of a clause or annex, called a “subsection” in United States English


6 XML encoding overview


6.1 Introduction


The specified XML Schemas encode definition data for both Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations (including coordinate Transformations and Conversions). This definition data includes identification and specification data, both included as needed. The definition data for a CRS includes or references definition data for a Coordinate System and a Datum, as appropriate. When applicable, definition data for a CRS includes or references definition data for a Coordinate Operation, and vice-versa.


The specified XML Schemas were prepared by converting the (revised) UML model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. Although most of the relevant information in that document was copied into these Schemas or into this document, Clauses 6 and 7 of Topic 2 contain some additional information applicable to these Schemas and their use.


NOTE 
The structure of the specified XML encoding closely follows the structure of the UML model, from which this XML encoding was converted.


6.2 Encoding structure


The specified XML encoding includes multiple alternative top level XML elements that can be used where needed. (That is, there is not a single top level element that may be the basis for all XML documents.) Most of these top level XML elements include identification information, allowing it to be referenced. The alternative top level XML elements include at least:


NOTE 1
A XML element that includes identification information is termed a “GML object” in GML 3. In some circles, an XML element with identity is termed a “module”. Each valid XML document must include a single top level XML element, often but not necessarily an element with identity. That single top level XML element need not be defined in this specification.


w) All concrete subtypes of the abstract CoordinateReferenceSystem XML element. These subtypes can each be used to transfer the definition of one coordinate reference system of that type. These subtypes of CoordinateReferenceSystem are the nine concrete XML elements named:


1) CompoundCRS


2) GeocentricCRS


3) GeographicCRS


4) ProjectedCRS


5) EngineeringCRS


6) ImageCRS


7) VerticalCRS


8) TemporalCRS


9) DerivedCRS


x) All concrete subtypes of the abstract CoordinateOperation XML element, namely:


10) ConcatenatedOperation. This element should be used to encode the definition of a concatenated coordinate conversion, which combines a specified sequence of Transformations and/or Conversions.


11) PassThroughOperation. This element should be used to encode the definition of a pass through coordinate conversion, which uses a specified Conversion or Transformation to convert a subset of the coordinates of a CompoundCRS.


12) Transformation. This element may be used to encode the definition of an approximate coordinate transformation, from one specified source coordinate reference system to another specified target coordinate reference system.


13) Conversion. This element may be used to encode the definition of an exact coordinate conversion, from one coordinate reference system to another coordinate reference system.


NOTE 2
The Conversion and Transformation elements should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods with many instances, see Subclause 6.3.


The concrete subtypes of CoordinateReferenceSystem use multiple lower level XML elements containing data structures. These lower level elements include all five concrete subtypes of the abstract Datum XML element, named:


a) GeodeticDatum


b) VerticalDatum


c) TemporalDatum


d) EngineeringDatum


e) ImageDatum


These lower level elements also include all ten concrete subtypes of the abstract CoordinateSystem XML element, named:


a) EllipsoidalCS


b) VerticalCS


c) CartesianCS


d) ObliqueCartesianCS


e) LinearCS


f) PolarCS


g) SphericalCS


h) CylindricalCS


i) TemporalCS


j) UserDefinedCS


The concrete subtypes of CoordinateOperation use multiple lower level elements containing data structures, including the elements named:


a) CovarianceMatrix


b) CovarianceElement


c) OperationMethod


d) OperationParameter


e) OperationParameterGroup


f) ParameterValue


g) ParameterValueGroup


NOTE 3
The ParameterValue and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods with many instances, see Subclause 6.3.


In addition to the concrete XML elements listed above, the Dictionary element in GML 3 is another alternative top level XML element. That Dictionary element can contain any combination of the concrete XML elements listed above, since all are substitutable for a Definition element in a Dictionary. A Dictionary element can also contain one or more UnitDefinition elements, as defined in units.xsd of GML 3. Also, any of these concrete elements or a Dictionary can be included inside a GenericMetaData element inside a metaDataProperty element, which can be included inside of many other XML elements.

6.3 Application schemas


As stated above, many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can be used without Application Schemas, whenever no content extensions or restrictions are needed. An Application Schema shall be used whenever element contents extension is required, and should be used in most other cases to specify needed restrictions. That is, an Application Schema should be defined to extend and/or restrict elements as needed for a specific application, or a set of applications, to:


y) Add elements to contents of existing elements, for recording additional data about that item needed for that application.


z) Restrict the multiplicity of current contents elements, to eliminate flexibility not needed and perhaps confusing for that application.


aa) Use a different element name, to be more easily understood in that specific application, primarily for elements that will be instantiated many times.


ab) Specify standard contents and contents patterns for selected elements and attributes, as needed to improve interoperability.


ac) Specify standard XML and other documents to be referenced or otherwise used, as needed to improve interoperability.


Application Schemas can thus be used for XML document contents extensions, restrictions, or both. Contents extension is expected to be often used to record additional data needed for applications. Contents restriction is expected to be frequently used to restrict contents, in order to increase interoperability and reduce ambiguity when greater flexibility is not needed for applications. Extensions of existing concrete elements can be defined by extending that concrete element. In many cases, restrictions of existing concrete elements can be done by extending the abstract element from which that concrete element is derived, by adding somewhat different but corresponding extensions. 


An Application Schema can specify a single top level element for use in an XML document, with the XML elements and types that it uses. That single top level XML element can be an object with identity, but this is not required. Such an Application Schema will import and build upon one or more of the six XML Schemas specified in this document.

Application Schemas could define additional concrete elements using or extending other abstract elements, if needed. However, an additional concrete element using or extending an abstract element should not be defined if that concrete element is largely similar to an existing element, and thus probably should extend or use an existing concrete element. In many cases, the existing concrete elements that use an abstract element are believed to be largely exhaustive. This is particularly true when the existing concrete elements include one element that is quite general, such as the elements EngineeringCRS, DerivedCRS, EngineeringDatum, UserDefinedCS, OperationParameter, and OperationParameterGroup.


The Conversion, Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements can be used for well-known coordinate operation methods, especially when only one instance of that element is needed for that operation method. However, these elements should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods when many instances of that element are needed for one operation method. Instead, an Application Schema that defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared for each such operation method. Subclauses F.3 and F.4 provide examples of such Application Schemas. For interoperability, a suitable geospatial information community should standardize each such Application Schema.


NOTE 
This use of Application Schemas follows the GML 3 patterns. This GML pattern is to generally use Application Schemas, especially when use of Application Schemas allows definition of XML Schema having: 1) complexTypes with more specific restrictions on the contents of elements, sometime in ways that allow XML parsers to more completely check for correct contents of XML documents, and 2) elements with more specific and understandable names, to make XML documents easier to understand by humans.


6.4 Profiles


Most Application Schemas and other uses of these CRS Schemas will use only a subset of the XML elements, types, and other capabilities defined in these CRS Schemas. Such a subset is termed a Profile, as specified in Subclause 7.16 of the GML 3 Implementation Specification. Briefly, a profile is a specified logical subset of the CRS Schemas plus the GML 3 schemas used with these CRS Schemas, selected to improve interoperability and reduce ambiguity. Such a profile should be specified by an Application Schema.


6.5 Namespace and version


All these XML Schema documents describe components in the http://www.opengis.net/gml namespace, for which the prefix "gml" is normally used.


Each XML Schema document carries a version attribute as defined in the XML Schema Recommendation. The format of the version attribute string is x.yy where x denotes the major version number and yy denotes a minor version number for that document. The current version is 3.00.


These XML Schemas use most of the GML 3 model and syntax specified in Subclause 7.2.1 of the GML 3.00 specification.


7 XML encoding


The standard XML encoding of CRS and coordinate operation definition data is specified in six XML Schema documents (using the file extension .xsd). These six XML schema files are named:


ad) referenceSystems.xsd


ae) coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd


af) datums.xsd


ag) coordinateSystems.xsd


ah) coordinateOperations.xsd


ai) dataQuality.xsd


These XML schema files are listed in Annex C, and copies of these files are also attached to this document. These six XML schemas correspond to the six packages in the UML model that was converted. Each XML schema includes <documentation> elements that define the XML elements and attributes, largely copied from the UML model.


These XML Schemas encoding CRS and coordinate operation definition data use nine XML schemas that are specified by GML 3. These XML schemas also include <documentation> elements that define the XML elements and attributes. Of course, these CRS Schemas use only some of the elements and types defined in these GML 3 schemas. These nine GML 3 schema documents are named:


aj) measures.xsd


ak) units.xsd


al) geometryBasic2d.xsd


am) geometryBasic0d1d.xsd


an) temporal.xsd

ao) dictionary.xsd


ap) gmlBase.xsd


aq) basicTypes.xsd


ar) xlink.xsd

Annex A
(normative)
 
Conformance


A.1
Conformance requirements


Each OGC Implementation Specification that uses XML encoding to transfer data defining coordinate reference systems and/or coordinate operations shall transfer definition data that conforms to this Recommendation Paper. Each relevant data transfer situation specified by such a specification shall transfer data that contains the entire applicable subset of the definition data specified in this Paper. Each such data transfer should include any additional data needed. Each relevant OGC Implementation Specification shall clearly specify the contents, structure, and format of the XML encoded data transferred in each specified data transfer situation, usually partially specified as an Application Schema based on these CRS schemas.


NOTE 1
In many cases, an Implementation Specification will specify the Application Programming Interface (API) to service software. In those cases, each specified data transfer situation is each input and output argument of each operation in a UML model of the service interface. Of course, multiple operation arguments will often transfer the same possible data, and thus use the same subset of the definition data specified here. Also, multiple arguments may use the same subset of the definition data specified here, although different arguments use different subsets of that data.


NOTE 2
Many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can be used without Application Schemas, if no contents extensions or restrictions are needed. However, the Conversion, Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods having many element instances. Instead, an Application Schema that defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared and standardized, see Subclause 6.3.


Whenever coordinate reference system and/or coordinate operation definition data is transferred using XML encoding, the data contents and structure specified herein shall be used wherever applicable. The data contents and structure aspects specified herein that shall be used include:


a) Name of each specified XML element and attribute


NOTE 3
When an Application Schema is used, the same name can be used in different namespaces.


b) Meaning of each specified name


c) Contents of each specified complexType


d) Sequence of elements included within each specified complexType


e) Multiplicity and optionality of each element and attribute in each specified complexType


f) Data type of each specified individual data item


When a data transfer situation requires a subset of the definition information specified here, a suitable subset profile can be used. When a data transfer situation requires a superset of the definition information specified here, a suitable Application Schema shall be specified, and its' use shall be required. Each such Application Schema shall conform to the Rules for Application Schemas specified in Subclause A.3. The changes permitted in an Application Schema include:


a) Add additional elements to a specified complexType, containing additional information


b) Omit a specified element, when not needed and that element is specified as being optional (minOccurs="0")


c) Remove some of the set of alternative elements in a specified <choice> data structure 


d) Make an optional element required (minOccurs not specified, default ="1")


e) Reduce specified maximum number-of-repetitions of an element


f) Change data type of an element to a more restrictive type


g) Restrict the meaning of a specified name, to match a restriction of an Implementation Specification


h) Specify standard contents and contents patterns for selected elements and attributes, for interoperability.


i) Specify standard XML and other documents to be referenced or otherwise used, for interoperability.


Many possible changes to the definition data specified here are not allowed, such as:


a) Completely change the definition of a specified name


b) Expand the set of alternative contents in a specified <choice> data structure


c) Make optional an element or attribute required in a specified complexType


d) Increase maximum number-of-repetitions of an element


e) Change data type of a specified element to a less restrictive type


f) Change the required order of elements in a specified complexType


A.2
Abstract test suite


Conformance of each application of these CRS Schemas shall be tested by inspecting the specification of each transferred XML encoded data structure and individual data item. The tested specification of XML encoded data shall include all Application Schemas used. This testing shall be done for each XML element and attribute that can be included in each specified data transfer. For each such XML element and attribute, the following questions shall be answered:


a) What is the (complete) meaning of this XML element or attribute?


b) Is this meaning part of the definition of an XML element or attribute specified herein? If not related, this data structure or item IS conformant.


c) Is this meaning similar to the meaning of any XML element or attribute specified herein? If not similar, this data structure or item IS conformant.


d) Is this meaning the same as, or a restriction of, the most similar meaning specified herein? If not the same or restricted, this data structure or item is NOT conformant.


e) Is the name of this XML element or attribute the same as the name of the corresponding item specified herein? If not the same name, this data structure or item is NOT conformant.


f) Is the type of this XML element or attribute the same as the type of the corresponding item specified herein, a subtype of that type, or a type with all the relevant contents of that type? If the type is not the same or equivalent, this item is NOT conformant.


If an individual XML element or attribute with a simpleType is being inspected, the questions continue:


g) Is the data type of this item the same as, or a subset of, the data type of the corresponding item specified here? If not the same or a subset, this data item is NOT conformant.


h) Does this element have a specified multiplicity range that extends outside the allowed multiplicity of the corresponding element specified here? If a larger multiplicity range is allowed, this element is NOT conformant.


If a XML element with a complexType is being inspected, the questions continue:


g) Do the contents of this complexType include all or a subset of the XML elements and attributes included in the corresponding complexType specified here? If doesn’t include all or a subset, this complexType is NOT conformant.


h) Do the contents of this complexType include the corresponding XML elements in the same required order? If not the same order, this complexType is NOT conformant.


i) If this complexType extends a complexType specified here, and the <documentation> element in that complexType specified here states constraints on inclusion of additional elements, and those constraints are not all satisfied, this complexType is NOT conformant.


j) For each XML element or attribute included in this complexType that has a corresponding item in the complexType specified here, is the element or attribute multiplicity (including optionality) compatible?


1) If the multiplicity and optionality are the same, this item IS conformant.


2) If an element or attribute is now omitted instead of optional, this item IS conformant.


3) If an element or attribute is now required instead of optional, this item IS conformant.


4) If an element or attribute is now optional instead of required, this item is NOT conformant.


5) If an element is now not repeated instead of being repeated one or more times, this item IS conformant.


6) If an element can now be repeated instead of not being repeated, this item is NOT conformant.


7) If the <documentation> element in the complexType specified here states a constraint on the multiplicity of this item and this constraint is not satisfied, this item is NOT conformant.


A.3
Rules for application schemas


A.3.1
Introduction


An Application Schema is an XML Schema that imports and builds upon one or more of the CRS set of six XML Schemas specified in Annex C. Such a Schema defines one or more XML elements useful for transfer of encoded geospatial data. An Application Schema can specify a single top level element for use by an XML document, with the XML elements and types that it uses. That single top level XML element can be an object with identity, but this is not required. Such a Schema with its' imported Schemas defines a vocabulary for a particular domain of discourse by defining and describing the terms of that vocabulary (see ISO TC/211 19109).


Conformance of an application of these CRS Schemas shall be tested by inspecting each Application Schema used, if any. Notice that the CRS set of XML Schemas specified in Annex C can be used without an Application Schema, and such use is allowed but discouraged. To use those XML Schemas without an Application Schema, any defined XML concrete element can be used as the basis for an XML document. There are about 30 such concrete elements defined that may be directly useful, and are listed in Subclause 6.2. In addition, all of those concrete elements can be used inside a GML 3 Dictionary element. Furthermore, all of those concrete elements or a Dictionary can be used inside a GenericMetaData element inside a metaDataProperty element, which can be included in many other elements.


The remainder of this subclause specifies the requirements (or rules) for an Application Schema to be considered conformant with this Recommendation Paper. Notice that it is clearly possible to develop Application Schemas that use the CRS Schemas specified herein which are valid XML Schemas but do not follow all these rules, and are thus not conformant with this Recommendation Paper.


A.3.2
General rules


All conformant Application Schemas shall be constructed by building upon one or more of the CRS set of six XML Schemas specified in Annex C. Such a Schema shall be a valid XML Schema, as specified in the XML Schema specification.


Each application schema must declare a target namespace. This is the namespace in which the XML elements or terms of the vocabulary “live”. This shall not be the GML namespace (http://www.opengis.net/gml). It is conventional for the namespace identifier to be a URL controlled by the application schema author’s organization. A target namespace is declared in the application schema using the targetNamespace attribute of the schema element from XML Schema.


A.3.4
Import needed schemas


An Application Schema must import the necessary XML Schemas specified in this document and from GML 3, with the correct namespace assignment. For example, in order to define coordinate reference systems, it is necessary to import coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, either directly or indirectly. Direct import is done by including the declaration:


<xsd:import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" schemaLocation="../coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd"/>

Notice that the <import> element specifies that the components described in coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd are in the GML namespace http://www.opengis.net/gml. This namespace identifier must match the target namespace specified in the schema being imported, to ensure XML Schema validity.


The schemaLocation of the imported .xsd file can be a local reference or a URI reference to the file. A URI reference can be to some remote repository, such as the repository http://schemas.opengis.net/ on the OGC web site. The above example assumes that the coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd file is stored locally at a location relative to this Application Schemas .xsd file.


Alternately, necessary XML Schemas can be imported indirectly, by importing another Application Schema that imports the needed Schemas.


In addition, the required import of a GML schema may be provided by the import of an equivalent subset schema as described in Subclause 7.14 of the GML 3 Implementation Specification, or by the import of an equivalent schema from a GML profile. These are all equivalent schemas with respect to satisfying the schema import requirements.


The above example imports coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, which (directly and indirectly) includes the other five CRS Schemas plus nine other GML 3 Schemas. For some Application Schemas, coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd may not be needed, but one or more of the other CRS Schemas may be needed.


A.3.5
GML objects and properties


The content models of almost all (about 30) concrete elements listed in Subclause 6.2 are derived from gml:DefinitionType, partially by restriction. These elements are ultimately derived from the AbstractGMLType and are thus GML Objects. These elements shall thus follow the GML class/property model, as specified in Subclause 7.2.2 of the GML 3 Implementation Specification. That is, the children of these elements must not be elements whose content models derive directly or indirectly from AbstractGMLType. The children of these elements are properties that describe that component.


A.3.6
Global and local names


Note that elements included in complex types that are defined with local names in an Application Schema will prevent derivation by restriction in another namespace, unless the local names are dropped in the restriction. Such complex types are appropriate for elements intended for use “as is” in their own namespace, and should be declared to be final=”restriction”. Elements included in complex types by reference to global elements support derivation by restriction in another namespace, allowing restriction of cardinality, and/or replacement by a member of a substitution group. Such complex types designed for derivation by restriction are appropriate “library types” for elements in substitution groups that cross namespaces.


A.4
UML models for application schemas


Each Application Schema can be produced by converting a UML model (or part of such a model), as required to comply with ISO 19118. If such a UML model is encoded, the XML encoding rules used should be similar to the encoding rules used for this document, as described in Annex G.


To comply with this specification, each such UML model shall be based on the same UML model as these CRS Schemas. For Application Schemas, subclasses can be defined for most non-abstract classes in this UML model. A subclass can extend and/or restrict a current concrete class to:


as) Add UML attributes and/or navigable associations, for recording additional data about that class needed for that application.


at) Restrict the multiplicity of current attributes and/or navigable associations, to eliminate flexibility not needed and perhaps confusing for that application.


au) Use a different class name, to be more easily understood in that specific application, primarily for classes that will be instantiated many times.


av) Specify standard or default contents for selected UML attributes, for interoperability.


Application Schemas could define additional concrete subclasses of abstract classes in this UML model, if needed. However, additional concrete subclasses should not be defined that are largely similar to existing subclasses, and thus probably should be a subclass of an existing concrete subclass. In most cases, the existing concrete subclasses of an abstract class are believed to be largely exhaustive. This is particularly true when the existing subclasses include one subclass that is quite general, such as the classes SC_EngineeringCSR, SC_DerivedCRS, CD_EngineeringDatum, CS_UserDefinedCS, and CC_OperationParameter.


Annex B
(informative)

Expected uses of CRS definition data


B.1
Introduction


The expected OpenGIS uses (or use cases) for transferring CRS and coordinate operation definition data produce requirements to be satisfied by this XML encoding. Three broad uses of such definition data transfer have been identified:


a) Use to transfer definition of a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), used by other geospatial data


b) Use to transfer definition of a Coordinate Transformation (CT), that can be performed by a coordinate transformation service


c) Use to transfer lineage or history of other geospatial data


Additional OGC uses of the proposed CRS and coordinate operation definition data might be identified in the future. These expected OGC uses assume the OGC is standardizing software-to-software interfaces (or Application Programming Interfaces, APIs) and associated data transfer formats, but is not (currently) trying to standardize human-computer interfaces.


Each OGC standard interface must allow both server and client software to be written that implements that interface. Simplicity of the interfaces is highly desirable, to simplify client software. Simplicity of server implementation software is somewhat important, but not as important as interface simplicity.


The following subclauses first discuss the multiple uses of definition data, the alternate ways in which definition data can be transferred, and then the three data transfer uses listed above.


B.2
Multiple uses of definition data


CRS and CT definition data can be used in at least three broad overlapping ways, to:


a) Describe a specific CRS or CT to a human user. Note that different human users need different degrees of definition detail.


b) Uniquely identify a specific CRS or CT to software. For a CRS, such identification can be used by software to check if different geospatial datasets are recorded using the same CRS, or to find additional data about a CRS that is stored elsewhere.


c) Provide data for performing coordinate transformations and conversions, useful to transformation software. For a CT, such data might be used to perform that transformation. For a CRS, such data might be used in transforming point positions to or from that CRS.


B.3
Alternative ways to transfer definition data


CRS and CT definition data can be transferred in three alternative ways:


a) Transfer only identifier and perhaps name, of each CRS or CT


b) Transfer complete specification, of each CRS or CT


c) Transfer partial specification with identifiers (and perhaps names) for remaining parts, of each CRS or CT


Only an identifier needs to be transferred for a complete CRS or CT, or for any part thereof, for any part that is well-known to the receiving software. Well-known usually means that some recognized authority has produced and published a complete specification of that part. Server software could have those well-known definitions coded into the software. Alternately, server software could be coded to access those definitions when needed from a separate service known to the server. Such a separate service may be maintained by the authority or by a third party.


In general, there will be several CRS and CT specification authorities that one server or client might use, separately and together. Of course, some software implementations may use no such authority, or only one such authority. One widely-used, publicly-available authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG), and use of this authority is currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. However, other and more private authorities exist and must be supported by some OGC standard interfaces, including military affiliated authorities (e.g., DIGEST). Somewhat private authorities are expected to be used for many engineering and image coordinate reference systems.


A complete CRS or CT specification must be transferred for a CRS or CT, or for any part thereof, for any part that is not well-known to the receiving software. Some server or client implementations could support no well-known CRS and/or CT definitions. More likely, some applications are expected to use some non-well-known CRS or CT definitions. For example, a grid coverage can use a CRS specific to that coverage. Also, an image coordinate transformation is likely to be specific to one image, and may not be supported by any authority that makes that CRS or CT well-known.


B.4
Use to transfer coordinate reference system definition


XML can be used to transfer the definition of a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) used by other geospatial data, especially data encoded using XML. In most cases, one geospatial dataset will use only one CRS. The definition of a CRS for a geospatial dataset can be transferred (usually through an OGC interface) for several different purposes, including:


a) Coordinate Transformation (CT) interface. The current Coordinate Transformation (CT) server interface allows use of XML to transfer definitions of CRSs. That is, a client can send the definition of one CRS that the client is requesting access, to server software. Similarly, the server software can send to a client the definition of one CRS that the client currently has access to.


b) Geography Markup Language (GML). The encoding of features in XML, now specified in the GML Implementation Specification, might use this CRS XML to define the CRS of a feature collection or feature.


c) Web Map Server (WMS) interface. A future version of the WMS interface might use XML to define the CRS that the client is requesting “map” data in. (The WMS interface does not currently use XML for this purpose.) In the current WMS interface, only well-known CRSs are supported, so only the identifier of that well-known CRS is transferred in a Get Map request.


d) Grid Coverage (GC) interface. A future version of the GC (access) interface might use XML to define the CRS used by a coverage, when requested by a client. (The current GC interface does not use XML for this purpose.) In the current draft GC interface, the CRS can be defined for one specific grid coverage, requiring transfer of a more complete specification of that CRS. That grid CRS is usually specified as a custom affine coordinate conversion or  transformation from another CRS.


B.4.1
Current CRS transfer by low-level CT interface


The current low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification (OGC document 01-009) supports XML transfer of a CRS definition in one operation and in one attribute.


The createFromXML operation of the CS_CoordinateSystemFactory <<Interface>> class creates a CS_CoordinateSystem object from a XML character string. One server will implement one CS_CoordinateSystemFactory object. The signature of this UML operation is:


    createFromXML (xml:CharacterString) : CS_CoordinateSystem


The “XML” read-only UML attribute of the CS_Info class allows a client to get an XML character string representation of an object, which can be either a CS_CoordinateSystem or a CS_Unit UML object. Objects of both the CS_CoordinateSystem and CS_Unit UML classes can be instantiated by multiple other objects visible to one client. Note that a CS_CoordinateSystem object can be created in several ways other than use of the createFromXML operation. The signature of this UML attribute is:


    XML : CharacterString


In the createFromXML operation, and when the UML attribute is used to get XML for a CS_CoordinateSystem object, the XML DTD for CS_CoordinateSystem provided in Section 15.1.1 (pages 113 through 115) of 00-007r4 is used. Example XML using that XML DTD is provided in Section 15.1.2 (pages 116 and 117) of 01-009. (Because that XML DTD and example XML are each more than one page, they are not copied here.)


NOTE 
A future version of the Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification could use XML in additional places, especially where use of WKT is now supported but use of XML is not now supported.


B.4.2
Current CRS transfer by ICT and high-level CT interfaces


The current draft high-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification (OGC document 01-013r1) supports XML transfer of a CRS definition by two operations. The same two operations are supported by the draft Image Coordinate Transformation (ICT) interface (OGC document 00-045r1). These two operations are provided to clients by the one Ground Coordinate Transformation Service <<Interface>> object. The UML operation signatures of these two operations are:


    addTransformation (metadata : TransformationMetadata, 
format : TextFormat) : TransformationID


    transformationMetadata (transformation : TransformationID, format : TextFormat) : TransformationMetadata


XML is one possible format used by the Transformation Metadata <<DataType>> class that is used by these two operations. The Transformation Metadata class contains three UML attributes, with the signatures:


    sourceCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition


    targetCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition


    transformation [0..1]: TransformationDefinition


The CoordinateReferenceSystem XML element, with all its contents, specified in this document could to be used for each Coordinate System Definition instance in the Transformation Metadata. (However, the Transformation XML element specified in this document, with all their contents, alternately could be used for complete Transformation Metadata, including both the source and target CoordinateReferenceSystems.)


B.5
Use to transfer coordinate transformation (CT) definition


XML can be used to transfer the definition of a Coordinate Transformation (CT) in the interfaces to Coordinate Transformation (CT) services. These interfaces include the accepted (low level) CT Implementation Specification, OGC document 01-009. These interfaces also include a high-level CT interface now proposed in document 01-013, plus draft Image Coordinate Transformation interfaces documented in 00-045r1. These CT interfaces use XML to transfer CT definitions with and without associated source and target CRSs.


B.5.1
Current CT transfer by low-level CT Interface


The current low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification (OGC document 01-009) supports XML transfer of a CT definition in one operation and one attribute.


The createFromXML operation of the CT_MathTransformFactory <<Interface>> class creates a CT_MathTransform object from a XML character string. One server will implement one CT_MathTransformFactory object. The UML signature of this operation is:


    createFromXML (xml:CharacterString) : CT_MathTransform


The “XML” read-only UML attribute of the CT_MathTransform class allows a client to get an XML character string representation of this UML object. Objects of the CT_MathTransform class can be instantiated by multiple UML objects visible to one client. Note that a CT_MathTransform object can be created in several ways other than use of the createFromXML operation. The signature of this UML attribute is:


    XML : CharacterString


For both of these XML uses, the XML DTD for CT_MathTransform provided in Section 15.1.1 (page 113) of 01-009 is used. Example XML using that XML DTD is not provided in 01-009. The XML DTD for CT_MathTransform now in Section 15.1.1 is:


    <!DOCTYPE CT_MathTransform [


    <!ELEMENT CT_MathTransform (


        CT_ConcatenatedTransform |


        CT_InverseTransform |


        CT_ParameterizedMathTransform |

NOTE 
This CT_MathTransform does not include any information on the source and target coordinate systems. Also, a future version of the low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification could use XML in additional places, especially where use of WKT is now supported but use of XML is not now supported.)


B.5.2
Current CT transfer by ICT and high-level CT interfaces


The current draft high-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) interface specification (OGC document 01-013) supports XML transfer of a CT definition by two operations. The same two operations are supported by the draft Image Coordinate Transformation (ICT) interface (OGC document 00-045r1). These two operations are provided to clients by the one Ground Coordinate Transformation Service <<Interface>> object. The signatures of these two UML operations are:


    addTransformation (metadata : TransformationMetadata, 
format : TextFormat) : TransformationID


    transformationMetadata (transformation : TransformationID, format : TextFormat) : TransformationMetadata


XML is one possible format used by the Transformation Metadata <<DataType>> class that is used by these two operations. The Transformation Metadata class contains three UML attributes, with the signatures:


    sourceCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition


    targetCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition


    transformation [0..1]: TransformationDefinition


The Transformation XML element specified in this document, with all their contents, could be used for a complete Transformation Metadata instance, including both the source and target CoordinateReferenceSystems. The Conversion XML element, with all its' contents probably can also be used for each Transformation Metadata instance.


B.6
Use to transfer dataset lineage or history


XML can be used to transfer the lineage or history of geospatial data, especially data encoded using XML. Such lineage information is specified by ISO 19115: Geographic information – Metadata to be part of the useful metadata about a dataset, and that metadata could be recorded in XML. (The OGC encourages use of ISO 19115 Metadata, but there are no uses of XML to transfer dataset lineage or history in current draft or accepted OGC Implementation Specifications.)


The lineage of a dataset, or of a part of a larger dataset, is likely to include the original CRS of the positions in that data, plus the sequence of coordinate transformations used to change these positions into the CRS in which the data is now recorded. Alternately, one concatenated coordinate transformation could be recorded that includes the original CRS and the sequence of coordinate transformations used. Similar metadata might be recorded for data still in the original CRS, but planned to be converted into a different CRS.


Annex C
(normative)

XML schemas


C.1
General


This clause lists the six XML Schemas for encoding coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation definition data, namely:


a) referenceSystems.xsd


b) coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd


c) datums.xsd


d) coordinateSystems.xsd


e) coordinateOperations.xsd


f) dataQuality.xsd


NOTE 
The XML Schemas listed in this annex are directly copied from the XML Schema Document files attached to this document. If any differences are discovered, please notify the editor and the OGC.


These XML Schemas include <documentation> elements for most of the XML Schema types defined, and for some of the XML elements defined. Where a XML element does not include a <documentation> element but the type it uses does, the type's <documentation> element applies to all the elements which use that type. These <documentation> elements specify the meaning of the corresponding XML elements and attributes. In addition, some <documentation> elements specify constraints on component elements and attributes. Most of the stated constraints are considered needed to fully comply with OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. All the contents of the <documentation> elements in these schemas are normative.

<conformance>This schema encodes the Reference System (RS_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2. The SC_CRS class is also encoded here, to eliminate the (circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. The RS_SpatialReferenceSystemUsingGeographicIdentifier class is not encoded, since it is not applicable to coordinate positions. The CI_Citation class is not directly encoded, since such information can be included as metaDataProperty elements which are optionally allowed. A modified version of the EX_Extent (DataType) class from ISO 19115 is currently encoded here, using GML 3 schema types. (A more extensive version of the EX_Extent package might be XML encoded in the future, probably in a separate extent.xsd schema.) </conformance>

<documentation>A coordinate reference system consists of an ordered sequence of coordinate system axes that are related to the earth through a datum. A coordinate reference system is defined by one datum and by one coordinate system. Most coordinate reference system do not move relative to the earth, except for engineering coordinate reference systems defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. For further information, see OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2.


Coordinate reference systems are commonly divided into sub-types. The common classification criterion for sub-typing of coordinate reference systems is the way in which they deal with earth curvature. This has a direct effect on the portion of the earth's surface that can be covered by that type of CRS with an acceptable degree of error. The exception to the rule is the subtype "Temporal" which has been added by analogy. </documentation>

<documentation>Description, possibly including coordinates, of the point or points used to anchor the datum to the Earth. Also known as the "origin", especially for engineering and image datums. The codeSpace attribute can be used to reference a source of more detailed on this point or surface, or on a set of such descriptions. 


- For a geodetic datum, this point is also known as the fundamental point, which is traditionally the point where the relationship between geoid and ellipsoid is defined. In some cases, the "fundamental point" may consist of a number of points. In those cases, the parameters defining the geoid/ellipsoid relationship have been averaged for these points, and the averages adopted as the datum definition.


- For an engineering datum, the anchor point may be a physical point, or it may be a point with defined coordinates in another CRS.


- For an image datum, the anchor point is usually either the centre of the image or the corner of the image.


- For a temporal datum, this attribute is not defined. Instead of the anchor point, a temporal datum carries a separate time origin of type DateTime. </documentation>

<documentation>An abstract operation on coordinates that does not include any change of datum. The best-known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.


This abstract complexType is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Conversion instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized element names and contents. This conversion uses an operation method, usually with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameters are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references the "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include zero or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "_generalParameterValue" element. </documentation>

Annex D
(informative)

Standard contents of code lists


D.1
Introduction


The XML Schemas specified in this document do not include definitions of the allowed values of the XML elements that encode the <<CodeList>> stereotyped classes specified in the UML model that was converted. Those XML elements are:


aw) derivedCRSType, in coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd


ax) pixelInCell, in datums.xsd


ay) verticalDatumType, in datums.xsd


Those XML elements are each required to include a "codeSpace" attribute with type "anyURI". The value of that attribute must reference a source of information specifying the values and meanings of all the allowed string values for this element. An Application Schema is expected to specify such a source of information, and how that source shall be referenced, whenever that Application Schema uses an XML element converted from a <<CodeList>> stereotyped class.

This annex specifies the standard set of string values and their meanings for each of the three XML elements listed above. This annex first specifies one possible XML Schema for encoding a standard set of string values and their meanings in an XML document. That possible application schema is then used to record each of the three standard sets of string values and their meanings.


D.2
XML schema for code lists


An XML document can be used to encode all the allowed string values with their meanings for an XML element that encodes one <<CodeList>> stereotyped UML class. One possible XML Schema for encoding such a standard set of string values and their meanings is:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Annex E
(informative)

XML document examples


E.1
Introduction


This annex provides example XML documents using the XML schemas specified in this document. These examples include both identification and specification data for many geospatial entities. These XML examples omit some optional XML elements and attributes that might be included, and include some optional elements and attributes that might be omitted. This omission or inclusion was partially based on whether reasonable values were known for optional elements and attributes. The optional elements that are omitted in these examples XML include:


a) The “remarks” element in all IdentifierType and object elements.


b) The "scope" element in all elements that could include it.


Most of these XML examples assume that the XML Schemas specified in Annex C are accessible using the location coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. These XML examples use patterns that are not specified in this document for values of the "gml:id", "gml:uom", "xlink:href", and "xlink:title" XML attributes.


EDITOR'S NOTE 
Some of the patterns now used for values of these attributes may be invalid or inappropriate. I urge reviewers to suggest any needed or desirable improvements.


NOTE 
For interoperability, the patterns or formats used for the values of these attributes must be specified somewhere, normally in or with an Application Schema.

E.2
Example XML for geographic 2D coordinate reference system


This subclause provides an example XML document using the Coordinate Reference System subtype GeographicCRS XML element, with its’ contained elements, applied to a geographic 2D coordinate system. This example XML is applicable to the current low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification, document 01-009.

Again, the above example XML just references the units #degree, #metre, and #one (a scale factor unit). Definitions of those units could be included in this XML document by adding a Dictionary element in a metaDataProperty of this CompoundCRS. This could be done in the same manner as shown in the second example XML document in Subclause E.2.

E.4
Simple example XML for compound coordinate reference system


The example XML document in the previous subclause includes many elements and attributes that are optional, and can thus be omitted when not needed. This subclause provides a simplified example XML document for the same 3D compound coordinate reference system, which omits most of the optional elements and attributes. This simplified example XML is intended to be adequate when the Projected CRS and the Vertical CRS are both well-known. That is, this simplified example assumes that server software can obtain the coordinate reference system specification and other data for these two coordinate reference systems using only the given "xlink:href" attribute values.

Example XML for Transverse Mercator conversion


This subclause provides an example XML document using the Coordinate Operation concrete subtype "Conversion" XML element, with its' contained elements, applied to an example Transverse Mercator map projection.


NOTE 
Subclause F.3.4 provides a corresponding example XML document using the example Transverse Mercator map projection XML Schema provided in Subclause F.3.3. That encoding of Transverse Mercator conversions is recommended, since multiple instances of the Transverse Mercator type of conversion are expected.

E.9
Referencing a coordinate reference system


The coordinate reference system (CRS) used by coordinates is referenced in the geometry XML elements defined by GML, and in a number of other places. GML 2 was limited to use of only well-known CRSs, so this reference to a CRS was abbreviated by a single attribute name and value, such as:


srsName=”EPSG:4326”


GML 3 still uses the srsName attribute, with type xsd:anyURI. This srsName can still be ”EPSG:4326”, or it can be a pointer to a more complete CRS definition stored somewhere else. That somewhere else could be any of several places, including:


az) Outside the XML document where it is referenced, such as:


14) In a dictionary of multiple CRS definitions available electronically from a specified URL. In this case, the srsName attribute could reference the dictionary, and the specific item in that dictionary.


15) In a dictionary of multiple CRS definitions not available electronically. However, the srsName attribute could still reference the dictionary, and the specific item in that dictionary.


16) In a catalog or registry service which stores CRS definitions, probably available electronically. In this case, the srsName attribute could reference the service, and the specific item available from that service. (The value ”EPSG:4326” can be considered to be a reference to the EPSG registry of CRS definitions.)


ba) Inside the XML document where it is referenced, such as:


17) In a dictionary of one or more CRS definitions stored as metadata in some XML element in that XML document. (Storing a dictionary of units as metadata is discussed in Subclause E.2.)


18) As one or more CRS definitions included in some XML element specified by an Application Schema based on the GML and/or CRS schemas.


In all cases listed above, the remote CRS definition could be XML encoded as specified in this document. For example, a XML encoded dictionary of CRS definitions could be similar to the units Dictionary example given in Subclause E.7. When the CRS definition is stored outside the XML document where it is referenced (item a) above), the remote CRS definition would not need to be encoded in XML.

Annex F
(informative)

Application schema examples


F.1
Introduction


This annex provides several example Application Schemas based on these CRS Schemas, each with a corresponding example XML document using that Application Schema plus the example UML model from which that Application Schemas was converted. For more information on Application Schemas, see Subclauses 6.3 and A.4.


These XML examples use patterns that are not specified in this document for values of the "gml:id", "gml:uom", "xlink:href", and "xlink:title" XML attributes.


EDITOR'S NOTE 
Some of the patterns now used for values of these attributes may be invalid or inappropriate. I urge reviewers to suggest any needed or desirable improvements.


NOTE 
For interoperability, the patterns or formats used for the values of these attributes must be specified somewhere, normally in or with the Application Schema.

F.2
Extended operation method definition


F.2.1
Introduction


Multiple needs are expected for encoding additional information describing coordinate reference systems and their components. This subclause provides an example of such extended encoding, applied to Operation Methods and Operation Parameters. The following subclauses contain:


bb) A draft class diagram of a UML package for an Extended Operation Method, which builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6.


bc) A draft XML Schema for encoding an Extended Operation Method, produced by converting this UML package.


bd) A XML encoding of the possible contents of the <<CodeList>> stereotyped ParameterType class in this UML package.


be) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an Extended Operation Method 


F.2.2

F.2.3
Application schema


This subclause contains an example XML Schema for encoding an Extended Operation Method, produced by converting the above UML package. This XML Schema builds on the coordinateOperations.xsd XML Schema contained in Subclause C.6. This draft XML Schema is written following the same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 XML encoding rules as used in the XML Schemas in Annex C. This draft XML Schema is written as an Application Schema in a different namespace.


This example XML Schema is:

Transverse Mercator conversion


F.3.1
Introduction


Standardized XML encoding is needed for a number of specific commonly-used types of coordinate conversions and transformations. This subclause provides an example of one such encoding, applied to one commonly-used conversion type, namely the Transverse Mercator map projection. The following subclauses contain:


bf) A draft class diagram of a UML package for the Transverse Mercator type of map projection, which builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6.


bg) A draft XML Schema for encoding a Transverse Mercator projection, produced by converting this UML package.


bh) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an example Transverse Mercator map projection


F.3.2
UML package


Figure F.2 is a draft class diagram of a UML package for Transverse Mercator map projections. This class diagram is incomplete in that many of the needed association role names and multiplicities are not shown due to lack of space. This UML package builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6.

F.3.3
Application schema


This subclause contains an example XML Schema for encoding a Transverse Mercator projection, produced by converting the above UML package. This XML Schema builds on the coordinateOperations.xsd XML Schema contained in Subclause C.6. This draft XML Schema is written following the same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 XML encoding rules as used in the XML Schemas in Annex C. This draft XML Schema is written as an application schema in a different namespace. Of course, it could be rewritten as an additional XML Schema in the GML namespace, and would be similar.


EDITORS NOTE: 
In this draft XML Schema, I included documentation element text based on my limited understanding of the Transverse Mercator map projection. I urge John Bobbitt, Roel Nicolai, and others to suggest improvements in the wording of these documentation elements.

F.4
Universal image geometry model transformation


F.4.1
Introduction


Standardized XML encoding is needed for a number of frequently-used types of image coordinate transformations. This subclause provides an example of one such encoding, applied to an example image coordinate transformation. That example type of image coordinate transformation is the one described in Section 6.5 of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 7: The Earth Imagery Case, namely the Universal Image Geometry Model (UIGM). That UIGM transformation is from a 3D ground coordinate reference system to a 2D image coordinate reference system, and has been simplified here for brevity. The following subclauses contain:


bi) A draft class diagram of a UML package for this simplified UIGM transformation, which builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6.


bj) Two draft XML Schemas for encoding this simplified UIGM transformation, produced by converting this UML package.


bk) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an example UIGM transformation, plus an example XML document based on the Application Schema in Subclause F.2.3 for encoding the Operation Method used by this UIGM transformation.


F.4.2
UML package


Figures F.3 to F.7 contain the five parts of a draft class diagram of a UML package for this simplified UIGM transformation. Figure F.3 shows the top level of the class diagram, without showing the components of the SectionParametersGroup and MonoscopicErrorsGroup. This diagram is incomplete in that some of the needed association role names and multiplicities are not shown due to lack of space. Figure F.4 shows the top level within the SectionParametersGroup, without showing the components of the NormalizationParametersGroup and PolynomialGroup. Figure F.5 shows one example parameter value in the NormalizationParametersGroup, with a note listing the other nine parameter values. Figure F.6 shows two example parameter values in the PolynomialGroup, with a note listing the six other parameter values. Figure F.7 shows the complete contents of the MonoscopicErrorsGroup.

F.4.3
Application schemas


This subclause contains example XML Schemas for encoding this simplified UIGM transformation, produced by converting the above UML package. These XML Schemas build on the coordinateOperations.xsd contained in Subclause C.6. These draft XML Schemas are written following the same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 XML encoding rules as used in the XML Schemas in Annex C. These XML Schemas are written as Application Schema in a different namespace.


The first draft Application Schema is:

The above example Application Schema is shortened by building on a separate example Application Schema. This other Application Schema defines XML Schema complexTypes for a number of types of operation parameter values. The complexTypes defined include 8 parameter types used in the Application Schema above, plus 8 more types expected to be useful in other image geometry model transformations. This second draft XML Application Schema is:

The above XML example uses dummy values such as "Aaaa" in place of real values for some text string values. Similarly, this example also uses dummy values such as "99.99" in place of real values for some numerical values. This example assumes that the Application Schemas specified in Subclause F.4.3 are accessible using the location UIGM1transformation.xsd.

The above XML example also assumes that (complete) information for several items is available elsewhere. The definition of the sourceCRS and targetCRS are assumed to be available elsewhere, and can be encoded in XML as shown in the example XML in Subclauses E.3 and E.10. The definition of the simplified UIGM OperationMethod can be XML encoded using the example Application Schema from Subclause F.2.3, and could be:

<gml:remarks>This operation method implements the universal image geometry model that transforms ground coordinates into georeferenced image coordinates. This image geometry model uses one ratio of two polynomial functions to compute the row image coordinate, and uses a similar ratio of two different polynomials to compute the column image coordinate. All four polynomials are functions of three ground coordinates: two horizontal coordinates and one vertical coordinate. In the polynomial functions, the three ground coordinates and two image coordinates are each offset and scaled to have a range from -1.0 to +1.0 over an image or image section. For brevity, this simplified operation method specification does not include all geometry model parameters or all optional XML elements. </gml:remarks>

Annex G
(informative)

UML to XML schemas conversion process


G.1
General


This document describes an application of ISO 19118 Annex A "XML based encoding rule" to a UML model of Coordinate Reference System and Coordinate Operation definition data. The UML model converted to XML Schemas is based on OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates (OGC 02-102). That UML model has been expanded and revised, to improve it and to slightly better support conversion to XML Schemas. That revised UML model is intended to replace the UML model now in Topic 2, and is currently documented in OGC document 03-009r6.


This conversion to XML Schemas was done in a manner that makes the results consistent with GML 3.0. Therefore, many of the details of many of the encoding rules used were adapted to produce XML Schemas consistent with the GML 3 schema patterns, and to use some of the XML elements and types defined in the GML 3 schemas.


NOTE 
Many of the GML 3 schema patterns are described in Subclauses 6.4, 7.1, 7.2. 8.1 through 8.3, and 8.6 of the GML 3.00 Implementation Specification.


This annex lists the "rules" used in this UML model to XML Schemas conversion process. Those rules are described in the following subclauses, for converting UML:


bl) Packages


bm) Classes


bn) Attributes


bo) Associations


bp) Multiplicities


bq) Other


G.2
Rules for packages


The rules used to convert UML model packages to XML Schemas were:


		Rule 1 

		Convert each UML package into a separate XML Schema Document. Name each XML Schema Document like the UML package, with spaces removed, the first character changed to lower case, and the word "System" made plural.



		Example

		UML package name: Coordinate Reference System


XML Schema name: coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd



		Reason(s)

		Produce multiple (i.e., 6) XML Schema documents (not one), following GML patterns.



		Exceptions

		None





		Rule 2 

		Begin each XML Schema Document with standard header information.



		Example

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<schema targetNamespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified" version="3.00" xml:lang="en">

<conformance>This schema encodes the Coordinate Reference System (SC_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates, with the exception of the abstract "SC_CRS" class. The "SC_CRS" class is encoded in referenceSystems.xsd, to eliminate the (circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2. </conformance>

================================================= -->


[Insert here XML encoded UML classes, attributes, and associations]


</schema>



		Reason(s)

		Produce XML Schema Documents that follow GML patterns.



		Exceptions

		None





		Rule 3 

		Include "xsd:include" statements in each XML Schema Document as needed for other XML Schema Documents referenced.



		Example

		[In coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd:]


<include schemaLocation="coordinateSystems.xsd"/>


<include schemaLocation="datums.xsd"/>


<include schemaLocation="coordinateOperations.xsd"/>



		Reason(s)

		Produce valid XML Schema Documents.



		Exceptions

		None





		Rule 4 

		Remove suffix containing two-letter UML package abbreviation plus following underscore character from class names, as classes and attribute data types are converted to XML Schema elements.



		Example

		UML class name: SC_GeographicCRS


XML element name: GeographicCRS



		Reason(s)

		Produce XML: Schema element names following the GML pattern.



		Exceptions

		None





		Rule 5 

		Encode EX_Extent UML class in referenceSystems.xsd, based on specification of that class in ISO 19115 but using relevant GML 3 complexTypes.



		Example

		Not applicable



		Reason(s)

		Not create another XML Schema document, for a short XML encoding



		Exceptions

		None





		Rule 6 

		Move XML encoded version of SC_CRS class to referenceSystems.xsd from coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd



		Example

		Move _CRS element, crsRef element, and related complexTypes.



		Reason(s)

		Remove prohibited circular reference between coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd and coordinateOperations.xsd. (TBR)



		Exceptions

		None





G.3
Rules for classes


The rules used to convert UML model classes to XML Schemas were:


NOTE 
Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML class into a <documentation> element of the XML complexType or element converted from this UML class attribute, in order to keep the UML class documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas.


		Rule 7 

		Convert each UML class with <<DataType>> stereotype to XML Schema global declaration of complexType, with same name augmented with "Type" suffix and with <documentation> element copying documentation of UML class.



		Example

		UML class: 



DQ_CovarianceElement


+ rowIndex : Integer


+ columnIndex : Integer


+ covariance : Double


<<DataType>>




XML Schema:



<complexType name="CovarianceElementType">



<annotation>




<documentation>An element of a covariance matrix.</documentation>



</annotation>



<sequence>




[Insert here XML elements encoding UML attributes]




</sequence>


</complexType>



<-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use XML Schema global complexType, with names following GML patterns.



		Exceptions

		a) Do not XML encode CI_Citation class, since such information can be included as metaDataProperty elements, which are optionally allowed. 


b) XML encode EX_Extent class in referenceSystems.xsd.



		Applies to

		UML classes: RS_Identifier, DQ_CovarianceElement, EX_Extent, CI_Citation





		Rule 8 

		Convert each UML class with <<CodeList>> stereotype to XML Schema global declarations of:


a) element with same name except first letter not capitalized, and having the following complexType.


b) complexType with same name augmented with "Type" suffix, with standard contents for a <<CodeList>> class except including <documentation> element copying documentation of UML class. 



		Example

		UML class:



CD_PixelInCell


+ cell center


+ cell corner


<<CodeList>>




XML Schema:



<element name="pixelInCell" type="gml:PixelInCellType"/>


<!-- =================================================== -->


<complexType name="PixelInCellType">

<documentation>Reference to a source of information specifying the values and meanings of all the allowed string values for this PixelInCellType. </documentation>






</annotation>





</attribute>




</restriction>



</simpleContent>


</complexType>


<!-- ================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Allow the specific values allowed in a CodeList to be specified elsewhere and referenced here.



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML classes: SC_DerivedCRSType, CD_PixelInCell, CD_VerticalDatumType





		Rule 9 

		Convert each UML class with <<Union>> stereotype to XML Schema global declarations of:


a) element with same name except first letter not capitalized, and having the following complexType.


b) complexType with same name augmented with "Type" suffix, containing a <choice> construct and <documentation> element copying documentation of UML class.



		Example

		UML class:



CD_SecondDefiningParameter


+ inverseFlattening : Scale


+ semiMinorAxis : Length


+ isSphere : String = "sphere"


<<Union>>




XML Schema:



<element name="secondDefiningParameter" type="gml:SecondDefiningParameterType"/>


<!-- =================================================== -->


<complexType name="SecondDefiningParameterType">



<annotation>




<documentation>Definition of the second parameter which defines the shape of an ellipsoid. An ellipsoid requires two defining parameters: semi-major axis and inverse flattening or semi-major axis and semi-minor axis. When the reference body is a sphere rather than an ellipsoid, only a single defining parameter is required, namely the radius of the sphere; in that case, the semi-major axis "degenerates" into the radius of the sphere.</documentation>



</annotation>



<choice>




[Insert here XML elements encoding UML attributes]




</choice>


</complexType>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use XML Schema global element and complexType.



		Exceptions

		For CC_ParameterValue class, add to complexType <documentation> some guidance for Application Schemas.



		Applies to

		UML classes: CD_SecondDefiningParameter, CC_ParameterValue





		Rule 10 

		Convert each UML class that is not a subclass of another class, has <<Abstract>> stereotype, and does not have (direct or inherited) identity, to XML Schema global declarations of:


a) element with same name except first letter not capitalized, having the following complexType and with abstract="true".


b) complexType with same name augmented with "Type" suffix, containing a <sequence> construct and <documentation> element copying documentation of UML class.



		Example

		UML class: 





DQ_PositionalAccuracy


+ 


measureDescription [0..1] : String

<annotation>




<documentation>Position error estimate (or accuracy) data. </documentation>



</annotation>



<sequence>




[Insert here XML elements encoding UML attributes]




</sequence>


</complexType>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use XML Schema global element and complexType, following GML patterns.



		Exceptions

		a) For CC_GeneralOperationParameter, extend gml:DefinitionType as described in following rule.


b) For CC_GeneralParameterValue, add to complexType <documentation> some guidance for Applications Schemas.



		Applies to

		UML classes: CC_GeneralParameterValue, DQ_PositionalAccuracy





		Rule 11 

		Convert CC_GeneralOperationParameter UML class (that is not a subclass of another class, has <<Abstract>> stereotype, and does not have (direct or inherited) identity), to XML Schema global declarations of:

G.4
Rules for attributes


The rules used to convert UML model (class) attributes to XML Schemas were:


NOTE 1
Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML attribute into a <documentation> element of the XML element converted from this UML attribute, in order to keep the UML attribute documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas.


NOTE 2
Most of these rules use global XML elements (instead of local elements inside another element) for flexibility. Use of global elements allows Application Schemas in another namespace to restrict tan element containing only global elements.


		Rule 19 

		Convert each UML attribute with type "Boolean" to XML Schema declarations of:


a) Reference to following element inside <choice> or <sequence> construct of "…Type" complexType converted from class containing this attribute.


b) Global element with same name, using type xsd:boolean, and with <documentation> element copying documentation of this UML attribute.



		Example

		UML attribute: 
+ booleanValue : Boolean


XML Schema:  Inside <choice> or <sequence> construct:



<element ref="gml:booleanValue"/>


Global element declaration:



<element name="booleanValue" type="boolean">



<annotation>




<documentation>Boolean value of an operation parameter. A Boolean value does not have an associated unit of measure. </documentation>



</annotation>


</element>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use xsd:boolean type.



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML attributes: booleanValue





		Rule 20 

		Convert each UML attribute with type "Date" to XML Schema declarations of:


a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> or <choice> construct of "…Type" complexType converted from class containing this attribute.


b) Global element with same name, using type xsd:date, and with <documentation> element copying documentation of this UML attribute.



		Example

		UML attribute: 
+ realizationEpoch [0..1] : Date


XML Schema:  Inside <sequence> or <choice> construct:



<element ref="gml:realizationEpoch" minOccurs="0"/>

Global element declaration:


<element name="realizationEpoch" type="date">



<annotation>




<documentation>The time for which this datum definition is valid. This time may be precise (e.g. 1997.0 for IRTF97) or merely a year (e.g. 1983 for NAD83). In the latter case, the epoch usually refers to the year in which a major recalculation of the geodetic control network, underlying the datum, was executed or initiated. </documentation>



</annotation>


</element>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use xsd:date type.



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML attributes: realizationEpoch





		Rule 21 

		Convert each UML attribute with type "DateTime" to XML Schema declarations of:


a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> or <choice> construct of "…Type" complexType converted from class containing this attribute.


b) Global element with same name, using type xsd:dateTime, and with <documentation> element copying documentation of this UML attribute.



		Example

		UML attribute: 
+ origin : DateTime


XML Schema:  Inside <sequence> or <choice> construct:



<element ref="gml:origin"/>

Global element declaration:


<element name="origin" type="dateTime">



<annotation>




<documentation>The date and time origin of this temporal datum. </documentation>

		Reason(s)

		Use xsd:dateTime type.



		Exceptions

G.5
Rules for associations


Most rules used to convert UML model (class) associations to XML Schemas are separately applied to each navigable end of each association. The rules used were:


		Rule 45 

		Do not XML encode the non-navigable ends of UML associations (usually without role names)



		Example

		None



		Reason(s)

		There is no need to navigate association in this direction.



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML association role names: None





		Rule 46 

		Do not XML encode the ends of UML "derived" associations.



		Example

		UML role name: 
+usesDatum
from SC_CoordinateReferenceSystem class


XML Schema:
(None)



		Reason(s)

		There is no need to navigate derived associations (instead of the basic associations).



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML association role names: 





The following rules for encoding associations apply to only the navigable end (always has a role name) of non-derived UML associations:


NOTE 
Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML association role into a <documentation> element of the XML element converted from this UML role, in order to keep the UML association role documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas.


		Rule 47 

		Convert each navigable end of each composition UML association to XML Schema declarations of:


a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> construct of the complexType converted from the class at the other end of this association.


b) Global element with same name, using the complexType encoded for the class at this end of the association, and with <documentation> element copying documentation of this UML role name.



		Example

		UML role name: 
+usesValue from CC_Operation class


XML Schema: Inside <sequence> construct:



<element ref="gml:usesValue" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>

Global element declaration:



<element name="usesValue" type="gml:ParameterValueType">



<annotation>




<documentation>Unordered list of composition associations to the set of parameter values used by this conversion operation. </documentation>



</annotation>


</element>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Follow GML pattern for properties. Define global element for flexibility.



		Exceptions

		None



		Applies to

		UML association role names: +usesValue from CC_Operation, +includesValue from CC_ParameterValueGroup, +includesElement from DQ_CovarianceMatrix





		Rule 48 

		Convert each navigable end of each aggregation of unspecified type of UML association to XML Schema declarations of:


a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> construct of the complexType converted from the class at the other end of this association.


b) Global element with same name, using the "xxxxRefType" encoded for the class at this end of this association, and with <documentation> element copying documentation of this UML role name.



		Example

		UML role name: 
+usesEllipsoid
from CD_GeodeticDatum class


XML Schema: Inside <sequence> construct:



<element ref="gml:usesEllipsoid"/>

Global element declaration:



<element name="usesEllipsoid" type="gml:EllipsoidRefType">



<annotation>




<documentation>Association to the ellipsoid used by this geodetic datum. </documentation>



</annotation>


</element>


<!-- =================================================== -->



		Reason(s)

		Use "xxxxRefType" following GML pattern for general associations. Define global element for flexibility.



		Exceptions

		a) If new global element declaration would be a duplicate, do not duplicate it.


b) If association has attached {XOR} note, see following rule.


c) For all +usesDatum role names to concrete classes for specific types of datums, change XML element name from "usesDatum' to the class name on this end of the association prefixed by "uses".


d) For all +usesCS role names to concrete classes for specific types of coordinate systems, change XML element name from "usesCS' to the class name on this end of the association prefixed by "uses".


e) For +usesOperation from CC_ConcatenatedOperation, change XML element name from "usesOperation" to " usesSingleOperation".



		Applies to

		UML association role names: +includesCRS from SC_CompoundCRS, +baseCRS from SC_GeneralDerivedCRS, +usesDatum from SC_GeocentricCRS, +usesDatum from SC_GeographicCRS, +usesDatum from SC_VerticalCRS, +usesDatum from SC_TemporalCRS, +usesDatum from SC_EngineeringCRS, +usesDatum from SC_ImageCRS, +usesCS from SC_EngineeringCRS, +usesCS from SC_GeographicCRS, +usesCS from SC_VerticalCRS, +usesCS from SC_TemporalCRS, +usesCS from SC_ProjectedCRS, SC_DerivedCRS, +usesCS from +usesEllipsoid from CD_GeodeticDatum, +usesPrimeMeridian from CD_GeodeticDatum, +usesAxis from CS_CoordinateSystem, +sourceCRS from CC_CoordinateOperation, , +targetCRS from CC_CoordinateOperation, +usesOperation from CC_ConcatenatedOperation, +usesOperation from CC_PassThroughOperation, +definedByConversion from SC_GeneralDerivedCRS, +usesMethod from CC_Operation, +usesParameter from CC_OperationMethod, +includesParameter from CC_OperationParameterGroup, +valueOfParameter from CC_ParameterValue, +valuesOfGroup from CC_ParameterValueGroup





		Rule 49 

		Convert each navigable end of an aggregation UML association with attached {XOR} note to XML Schema declarations of a reference to the appropriate element. Put this element inside a <choice> construct and without minOccurs="0", inside the <sequence> construct of the complexType converted from the class at the other end of this association.



		Example

		UML role name: 
+usesSphericalCS from SC_GeocentricCRS class

and


+usesCartesianCS from SC_GeocentricCRS class


XML Schema: Inside <sequence> construct:






<choice>







<element ref="gml:usesCartesianCS"/>







<element ref="gml:usesSphericalCS"/>






</choice>





		Reason(s)

Annex H
(informative)

Coordinate operation methods


H.1
Introduction


This annex contains a non-exhaustive description of some conversion and transformation operation methods. It lists a number of methods defined in the EPSG v 6.3 well-known data set, plus a few other often used methods and some methods applicable to the transformation of image coordinates.


Each operation method should uniquely specify the algorithm to be used for a coordinate transformation. This specification may comprise two algorithms, forward and inverse, as is sometimes used for map projection algorithms. Each conversion and transformation, and each operation method, should use a well-known data set in referencing such algorithms.


NOTE 
Of course, referencing a well-known algorithm does not imply that software which implements these algorithms has correctly implemented it, or has implemented all referenced algorithms. Similarly, referencing a well-known set of parameter values does not imply that software which implements these values uses the correct values.


H.2
EPSG defined operation methods


The well-known data set from EPSG (version 6.3) specifies a number of operation methods. Please note that the EPSG data set is neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive. This document lists a subset of the methods in the EPSG data set. Methods not listed in this document, but listed in the EPSG data set, can easily be implemented using the OperationMethod and OperationParameter elements, making use of the method name and parameter names specified in the EPSG data set.


These operation methods are defined making use of well-defined operation parameters. When a coordinate operation is specified referencing an EPSG defined operation method, the detailed specification in an XML document should adhere to the EPSG definitions of the operation parameters.


The detailed definition of these operation method algorithms, with their formulas and a worked example is included in the EPSG data set, available on the Web, through the reflector: http://www.epsg.org/

These and other information on coordinate operation methods is available on: http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/

H.3.
Other operation methods 


H.3.1
Introduction


The following operation methods are not specified in any well-known data set but are implied in the specification of Coordinate Systems and Coordinate Reference Systems.


br) Polar / Cartesian (2D) conversion


bs) Spherical / Cartesian (3D) conversion


bt) Cylindrical / Cartesian conversion


bu) Linear to Cartesian (2D) conversion


bv) Linear to Cartesian (3D) conversion


bw) Geographic3D to Geographic2D/GravityRelatedHeight conversion


H.3.2
Polar / Cartesian (2D) conversion


This method converts two-dimensional polar coordinates to plane Cartesian coordinates and vice versa (the inverse algorithm is implied in this transformation method).


H.3.3
Spherical / Cartesian (3D) conversion 


This method converts spherical coordinates (sometimes referred to as polar 3D coordinates) to 3D Cartesian coordinates and vice versa (the inverse algorithm is again implied in this transformation method). Please bear in mind that when the spherical coordinate system is used in a local context (i.e., in an EngineeringCRS); the converted Cartesian coordinate system can only be used in the same context: there is no datum change involved. Transformation to a Geocentric Cartesian system is possible only when the spherical coordinate system is also geocentric. 


H.3.4
Cylindrical / Cartesian conversion


This method converts (3D) cylindrical coordinates to 3D Cartesian coordinates and vice versa. The area of use of the cylindrical coordinate system is unlikely to be other than local. The Cartesian coordinate system will therefore also be associated with an EngineeringCRS. A further (or indeed a one-step) transformation to a Geocentric system will be incorrect, although it may seem mathematically correct.


H.4
Image coordinate transformation methods 


H.4.1
Introduction


This subclause discusses the following non-exhaustive list of coordinate transformation types applicable to image coordinate reference systems: 


bx) Ground-to-image transformations

by) Single-image-to-ground transformations


bz) Elevation coverage with single-image-to-ground transformations


ca) Elevation coverage for 2D to 3D coordinate transformations


cb) Elevation coverage with single ground-to-image transformations


H.4.2
Ground-to-image transformations


This set of operation methods defines transformations used for ground-to-image coordinate transformations, with one method used for each image geometry model type. The input to such a transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the output is usually 2D image coordinates. These methods will usually use parameters for directly transforming 3D ground coordinates to 2D image coordinates.


H.4.3
Single-image-to-ground transformations


This set of operation methods defines transformations used for single (or monoscopic) image-to-ground transformations, with one operation method used for each image geometry model type. These methods could use parameters for directly transforming 2D image coordinates to multiple 3D ground coordinates. However, these parameterized transformations could use parameters for directly transforming 3D ground coordinates to 2D image coordinates (like ground-to-image transformations).


The output from such a transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the input can be compound 2D image plus 3D ground coordinates. In that case, the 3D ground coordinates are used to provide a fixed elevation value, to be used with the 2D image input coordinates. The horizontal position is included with each elevation to facilitate ground coordinate transformations. Inclusion of the horizontal position also allows the client to provide an approximate horizontal ground position, when known. Server software implementing such transformations is allowed to make use of this approximate horizontal position, to speed computation.


H.4.4
Elevation coverage with single-image-to-ground transformation


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage with a single-image-to-ground transformation. One operation method can be used for any elevation coverage that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A transformation parameter should reference one elevation coverage from one external elevation coverage service. This assumes that interface implementations will first use a separate single-image-to-ground transformation to compute two or more points along the image ray. The implementation will then intersect this ray with ground shape defined by elevation coverage.


The output from this transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the input can be compound 2D image plus 3D ground coordinates (plus the separately specified elevation coverage). In that case, the input 3D ground coordinates are used to provide an approximate elevation value, to be used with the 2D image input coordinates. The horizontal position is included with each elevation to facilitate ground coordinate transformations. Inclusion of the horizontal position also allows the client to provide an approximate horizontal ground position, when known. Server software implementing such transformations is allowed to make use of this approximate horizontal position, to speed computation.


H.4.5
Elevation coverage for 2D to 3D coordinate transformation


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage for 2D to 3D coordinate transformations. One operation method can be used for any elevation coverage that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A transformation parameter should reference one elevation coverage from one external elevation coverage service. The input to this transformation is 2D horizontal coordinates (plus the separately specified elevation coverage), and the output is 3D coordinates. This transformation can be used in a Concatenated Transformation with a ground-to-image transformation, to go from 2D ground coordinates to 2D image coordinates.


H.4.6
Elevation coverage with single ground-to-image transformation


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage with a single ground-to-image transformation. One operation method can be used for any elevation coverage that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A transformation parameter should reference one elevation coverage from one external elevation coverage service. The input to this transformation is 2D horizontal ground coordinates (plus the separately specified elevation coverage), and the output is usually 2D image coordinates. An implementation of this parameterized transformation is expected to first use the elevation coverage to obtain the third ground coordinate, and then use a separate implementation of a ground-to-image transformation.


Annex I
(informative)

Schema flexibility


I.1
Introduction


This annex summarizes the flexibility supported by the CRS set of XML Schemas specified in Annex C. Much of this flexibility applies to the Application Schemas that can and should be developed using these CRS Schemas. However, considerable flexibility is supported without using an Application Schema, just using a selected XML element as the basis for an XML document.


NOTE 1
Specification flexibility will reduce interoperability whenever different implementations support different subsets of the allowed flexibility. To maximise interoperability, each Implementation Specification using this specification should specify the subset required to be implemented (especially by a server), for each flexibility area allowed by this specification. Some of this subset specification can be done in the Application Schema(s) specified by that Implementation Specification.


NOTE 2
Many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can be used without Application Schemas, when no contents extensions or restrictions are needed. However, the Conversion, Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods having many instances. Instead, an Application Schema that defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared and standardized, see Subclause 6.3.


I.2
Application Schema flexibility 


The CRS Schemas specified in Annex C support considerable flexibility in an Application Schema. That flexibility includes:


cc) Defining elements that can be attached as metadata to each (of about 30) concrete elements with identity (or GML objects).


cd) Extending most complexTypes by adding elements selected and/or defined to record additional data about the elements using that complexType.


ce) Restricting most complexTypes to reduce the allowed multiplicity of an included element, or restrict an included element to a selected element defined in the substitutionGroup of the currently included element.


cf) Extending some abstract complexTypes by adding elements deliberately not included in the abstract type, to facilitate definition of differently named and/or structured elements in Application Schemas. Those complexTypes include:


19) AbstractGeneralConversionType

20) AbstractGeneralTransformationType

21) AbstractGeneralParameterValueType

NOTE 1
Such use of Application Schemas is discussed in Subclause 6.3, and example Application Schemas extending two of these three complexTypes is provided in Subclauses F.3 and F.4.


cg) Using or extending some abstract complexTypes and elements to define additional concrete subtypes. Those elements and complexTypes include:


22) _CoordinateReferenceSystem, with AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystemType


23) _GeneralDerivedCRS, with AbstractGeneralDerivedCRSType


24) _CRS, with AbstractCRSType

25) _Datum, with AbstractDatumType


26) _CoordinateSystem, with AbstractCooordinateSystemType


NOTE 2
These abstract complexTypes shall not be used or extended (in an Application Schema) to define a concrete subtype with a meaning equivalent to a concrete subtype specified in this document. If needed, these abstract complexTypes can be extended in an Application Schema to add more contents. Also if needed, these abstract complexTypes may be used or extended (in an Application Schema) to define an additional concrete subtype with a different meaning.


EDITORS NOTE 
These CRS schemas currently allow such uses and extensions because XML Schemas cannot preclude such uses. If appropriate, constraints could be added to the <documentation> elements for these complexTypes to prohibit undesirable additional concrete subtypes.


I.3
Other flexibility


In addition to flexibility provided by preparing an Application Schema, the CRS Schemas specified in Annex C support considerable flexibility without using an Application Schema. That flexibility includes:


ch) Units of measure (uom) used for each:


27) "value" element in ParameterValueType, even for a single parameter


28) "uom" attribute in CoordinateSystemAxisType

29) "result" element in AbsoluteExternalPositionalAccuracyType and RelativeInternalPositionalAccuracyType

ci) Subtypes of AbstractPositionalAccuracyType used in AbstractCoordinateOperationType and all four of its' concrete subtypes.


cj) A Dictionary element can contain any combination of the concrete XML elements listed in Subclause 6.2, since all are substitutable for a Definition element in a Dictionary. A Dictionary element can also contain one or more UnitDefinition elements, as defined in units.xsd of GML 3. Furthermore, any of these concrete elements or a Dictionary can be included inside a GenericMetaData element inside a metaDataProperty element, which can be inside of many other XML elements.

ck) Defining new and different sets of standardized values to be used as the contents of many elements with the gml:CodeType and xsd:string data types. Those elements include:


30) derivedCRSType, in DerivedCRSType

31) pixelInCell, in ImageDatumType

32) verticalDatumType, in VerticalDatumType

33) axisDirection, in CoordinateSystemAxisType

34) axisAbbrev, in CoordinateSystemAxisType

35) "scope", in AbstractReferenceSystemType, AbstractDatumType, AbstractCoordinateOperationType, and all of their subtypes


36) anchorPoint, in each of four subtypes of AbstractDatumType

37) measureDescription, in each of three subtypes of AbstractPositionalAccuracyType

i. Preface 


This OpenGIS© Recommendation Paper specifies basic XML encoding of data defining 
coordinate reference systems and coordinate operations. This encoding is expected to be 
adapted and used by multiple OGC Implementation Specifications, by the separate 
specification of Application Schemas. This document is a Recommendation Paper 
because the specified encoding is more general than an OpenGIS Implementation 
Specification and more specific than the OpenGIS Abstract Specification. 


NOTE 1 This document does not specify all the things needed to ensure interoperability between 
different implementations of software using these CRS Schemas. Some of the additional things that should 
be specified to ensure interoperability are listed in Clause iv: Future work. These things may be specified in 
a separate OGC specification, or perhaps added in a revised version of this document. The CRS WG 
intends to do this work as soon as practical.  


This Recommendation Paper replaces OpenGIS Recommendation Paper 01-014r5, titled 
"Recommended Definition Data for Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate 
Transformations". The key changes in this revised Recommendation Paper are: 


a) Use XML schemas to specify the XML encoding, instead of using XML DTDs. 


b) Derive the recommended XML schemas by encoding the UML model in OGC 
Abstract Specification Topic 2 "Spatial Referencing by Coordinates". 


NOTE 2 The revised UML model for Topic 2 is contained in document 03-009r6. That model is 
supplemented by the UML model of the EX_Extent class in ISO/FDIS 19115. 


c) Derive the XML schemas by adapting the XML encoding rules described in 
Subclause A.5 of the N1316 draft of ISO 19118 "Geographic information - 
Encoding". 


NOTE 3 Document N1316 is supplemented by XML Schema documents posted on David Skogan’s web 
page on ISO 19118 encoding: http://www.ifi.uio.no/~davids/encoding. 


d) Build upon central parts of the GML 3.0 XML schemas, using some GML 3.0 
schema documents and most GML 3 encoding patterns. 


NOTE 4 Many of the GML 3 schema patterns are described in Subclauses 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 through 8.3, 
and 8.6 of the GML 3.00 Implementation Specification. 


Many key contents of this document are also provided in the attached set of files, in the 
file 03-010r7a.zip. These files include the six XML Schema documents (.xsd files) 
specifying the recommended XML encoding of coordinate reference system (CRS) and 
coordinate operation definition data. These six files are named referenceSystems.xsd, 
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, datums.xsd, coordinateSystems.xsd, 
coordinateOperations.xsd, and dataQuality.xsd. The attached files also include: 


a) Current versions of the nine XML Schema documents from GML 3.0 that are used by 
these CRS schemas, and are needed to validate these CRS Schemas.

iii. Changes to the OpenGIS Abstract Specification 


The OpenGIS Abstract Specification Topic 2 "Spatial Referencing by Coordinates" 
should be changed to use the revised UML model proposed in OGC 03-009r6. 


iv. Future work 


Improvements of this document are needed to: 


a) Modify XML schemas to reflect any further changes in UML model (see further work 
clause in document 03-009r6) 


b) Resolve question if too much flexibility is provided in coordinateOperations.xsd (at 
the expense of interoperability) 


c) Specify how to reference items in the EPSG and other well-known data bases of 
CRS-related definition data (tentatively using URNs) 


d) Specify standard XML encodings of some well-known operation methods, coordinate 
operations, CRSs, units, etc., and specify how to reference these standard XML 
documents (perhaps using URLs) 


e) Specify how to reference items in customized repositories or catalogs of CRS 
definition data (perhaps used by specific OGC Implementation Specifications) 


NOTE  The last three items listed above are clearly needed to support interoperability (see Note 1 in 
Clause i.). The CRS WG intends to do this work as soon as practical. These items may be specified in a 
separate OGC specification, or perhaps added in a revised version of this document. 


v. Background 


The Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) Working Group (formerly the Coordinate 
Transformation Working Group) has been developing XML Schemas specifying XML

encoding of Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and Coordinate Transformation (CT) 
definition data. Those schemas were previously being developed largely without directly 
using any UML model, and largely by converting to XML Schemas the XML DTD 
specified in OGC Recommendation Paper 01-014r5: Recommended Definition Data for 
Coordinate Reference Systems and Coordinate Transformations. 


The N1316 draft of ISO 19118 requires XML encoding of geospatial data to be 
developed by converting a UML model of the data to be encoded into the corresponding 
XML schemas. This conversion must be done in a largely mechanical fashion, using a set 
of UML to XML Schema conversion rules. Subclause A.5 of the N1316 specifies a draft 
set of UML to XML schema conversion rules, but explicitly allows variations of those 
rules to be used, if those variations are documented. 


Some prospective users of OGC-specified XML encoding strongly desire that all such 
XML encoding specifications be compliant with ISO 19118. The XML schemas 
previously being developed by the CRS WG were not compliant with ISO 19118, 
partially because they did not convert a UML model to XML schemas. In particular, that 
draft encoding did not directly convert the UML model developed for Topic 2 of the 
OGC Abstract Specification. 


This revised Recommendation Paper improves the relevant XML work previously done 
by the Open GIS Consortium (OGC). The OpenGIS-accepted CT Implementation 
Specification already specifies a XML DTD for CRSs and CTs. The now-superseded 
GML 1 Recommendation Paper included an informative annex that specified a XML 
DTD for CRSs, including some CTs. These two XML DTDs are significantly different, 
and both appear to be incomplete.

Introduction 


This document specifies a standard XML encoding for data defining Coordinate 
Reference Systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations, specified using XML Schemas. 
This CRS and coordinate operation definition data will often be transferred between 
client and server software that implements various standardised interfaces and data 
formats. This specified general definition data encoding is intended for use in multiple 
OGC Implementation Specifications. That is, each of these specifications is expected to 
use a subset and/or superset of this standard definition data, by specifying and using 
Application Schemas that build on these XML Schemas. 


The position or location of a point can be described using coordinates. Such coordinates 
are unambiguous only when the coordinate reference system on which those coordinates 
are based is fully defined. Each position is described by a set of coordinates based on a 
specified coordinate reference system. Coordinates are often used in datasets in which all 
coordinates belong to the same coordinate reference system. This paper specifies XML 
encoding of data defining coordinate reference systems for point coordinates. 


The same point position will usually have different coordinates in different coordinate 
reference systems. There are a large number of different coordinate reference systems in 
current use. Coordinates from different datasets will thus often have different coordinate 
reference systems. In order to use together positions from different coordinate reference 
systems, known point coordinates often must be transformed into the corresponding 
coordinates in a different coordinate reference system. This paper specifies XML 
encoding of data defining such coordinate transformations

Recommended XML encoding of coordinate reference system 
definitions 


1 Scope 


This OpenGIS© standard specifies standard XML encodings of definition data for 
Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and coordinate operations, specified using XML 
Schemas. This encoding is intended for use when transferring such definition data 
between client and server software that uses OpenGIS standard interfaces, as specified in 
other documents. The expected uses of this definition data transfer include those 
described in Annex B (informative). 


Definition data encoding is specified herein for multiple types of CRSs, including: 


a) Geocentric coordinate reference systems 


b) Geographic coordinate reference systems 


c) Projected coordinate reference systems 


d) Engineering coordinate reference systems 


e) Vertical coordinate reference systems 


f) Temporal coordinate reference systems 


g) Image coordinate reference systems 


h) Derived coordinate reference systems 


i) Compound coordinate reference systems, combining two or more other coordinate 
reference systems 


Definition data encoding is also specified herein for multiple types of coordinate 
operations, including: 


a) Parameterized coordinate transformations and conversions 


b) Concatenated coordinate transformations, combining two or more coordinate 
transformations 


c) Pass-through coordinate transformations, using another coordinate transformation 


The current scope of this encoding does not include: 


a) Vertical coordinate reference systems with time units 


b) Specific well-known coordinate conversions and transformations

This OpenGIS standard specifies standard XML encoding of CRS and coordinate 
operation definition data applicable to multiple separate OpenGIS interface 
Implementation Specifications. Each such Implementation Specification should specify 
one or more subsets and/or supersets of the definition data specified herein, each to be 
used for one or more purposes. That is, for each type of XML document used, the 
Implementation Specification should specify one or more Application Schemas that are 
similar to the Application Schemas required to use GML. 


Those OpenGIS standard interfaces are implemented by service software that performs 
functions for separate client software. Those Implementation Specifications, or profiles of 
those Implementation Specifications, can use any Distributed Computing Platform 
(DCP). CRS and/or coordinate operation definition data will often be transferred encoded 
in XML documents. However, other encodings can be used, such as Well Known Text 
(WKT). 


2 Conformance 


Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified 
in Annex A (normative). The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the 
criteria to be achieved to claim conformance, are specified in ISO 19105: Geographic 
information — Conformance and Testing. 


3 Normative references

Figure 1 — UML notation 


In these UML class diagrams, the class boxes with three compartments and a light 
background are the primary classes being shown in this diagram, often the classes from 
one UML package. The class boxes without compartments and with a gray background 
are other classes used by these primary classes, usually classes from other packages. 


In this specification, the following four stereotypes of UML classes are used: 


a) <<Abstract>> A polymorphic object class that cannot be instantiated. 


b) <<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent 
existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations 
whose primary purpose is to hold the information. 


c) <<CodeList>> A flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of 
potential values. 


d) <<Union>> Contains a list of attributes where only one of those attributes can be 
present at any time. 


In this specification, the following standard data types are used:

6 XML encoding overview 


6.1 Introduction 


The specified XML Schemas encode definition data for both Coordinate Reference 
Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations (including coordinate Transformations and 
Conversions). This definition data includes identification and specification data, both 
included as needed. The definition data for a CRS includes or references definition data 
for a Coordinate System and a Datum, as appropriate. When applicable, definition data 
for a CRS includes or references definition data for a Coordinate Operation, and vice-
versa. 


The specified XML Schemas were prepared by converting the (revised) UML model for 
OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. Although most 
of the relevant information in that document was copied into these Schemas or into this 
document, Clauses 6 and 7 of Topic 2 contain some additional information applicable to 
these Schemas and their use. 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 7 
 


NOTE  The structure of the specified XML encoding closely follows the structure of the UML model, 
from which this XML encoding was converted. 


6.2 Encoding structure 


The specified XML encoding includes multiple alternative top level XML elements that 
can be used where needed. (That is, there is not a single top level element that may be the 
basis for all XML documents.) Most of these top level XML elements include 
identification information, allowing it to be referenced. The alternative top level XML 
elements include at least: 


NOTE 1 A XML element that includes identification information is termed a “GML object” in GML 3. 
In some circles, an XML element with identity is termed a “module”. Each valid XML document must 
include a single top level XML element, often but not necessarily an element with identity. That single top 
level XML element need not be defined in this specification. 


a) All concrete subtypes of the abstract CoordinateReferenceSystem XML element. 
These subtypes can each be used to transfer the definition of one coordinate reference 
system of that type. These subtypes of CoordinateReferenceSystem are the nine 
concrete XML elements named: 


1) CompoundCRS 


2) GeocentricCRS 


3) GeographicCRS 


4) ProjectedCRS 


5) EngineeringCRS 


6) ImageCRS 


7) VerticalCRS 


8) TemporalCRS 


9) DerivedCRS 


b) All concrete subtypes of the abstract CoordinateOperation XML element, namely: 


1) ConcatenatedOperation. This element should be used to encode the definition of 
a concatenated coordinate conversion, which combines a specified sequence of 
Transformations and/or Conversions. 


2) PassThroughOperation. This element should be used to encode the definition of 
a pass through coordinate conversion, which uses a specified Conversion or 
Transformation to convert a subset of the coordinates of a CompoundCRS. 


3) Transformation. This element may be used to encode the definition of an 
approximate coordinate transformation, from one specified source coordinate 
reference system to another specified target coordinate reference system. 


4) Conversion. This element may be used to encode the definition of an exact 
coordinate conversion, from one coordinate reference system to another 
coordinate reference system. 







OGC 03-010r7 


8 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


NOTE 2 The Conversion and Transformation elements should not be used for well-known coordinate 
operation methods with many instances, see Subclause 6.3. 


The concrete subtypes of CoordinateReferenceSystem use multiple lower level XML 
elements containing data structures. These lower level elements include all five concrete 
subtypes of the abstract Datum XML element, named: 


a) GeodeticDatum 


b) VerticalDatum 


c) TemporalDatum 


d) EngineeringDatum 


e) ImageDatum 


These lower level elements also include all ten concrete subtypes of the abstract 
CoordinateSystem XML element, named: 


a) EllipsoidalCS 


b) VerticalCS 


c) CartesianCS 


d) ObliqueCartesianCS 


e) LinearCS 


f) PolarCS 


g) SphericalCS 


h) CylindricalCS 


i) TemporalCS 


j) UserDefinedCS 


The concrete subtypes of CoordinateOperation use multiple lower level elements 
containing data structures, including the elements named: 


a) CovarianceMatrix 


b) CovarianceElement 


c) OperationMethod 


d) OperationParameter 


e) OperationParameterGroup 


f) ParameterValue 


g) ParameterValueGroup 
NOTE 3 The ParameterValue and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known 
coordinate operation methods with many instances, see Subclause 6.3. 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 9 
 


In addition to the concrete XML elements listed above, the Dictionary element in GML 3 
is another alternative top level XML element. That Dictionary element can contain any 
combination of the concrete XML elements listed above, since all are substitutable for a 
Definition element in a Dictionary. A Dictionary element can also contain one or more 
UnitDefinition elements, as defined in units.xsd of GML 3. Also, any of these concrete 
elements or a Dictionary can be included inside a GenericMetaData element inside a 
metaDataProperty element, which can be included inside of many other XML elements. 


6.3 Application schemas 


As stated above, many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can 
be used without Application Schemas, whenever no content extensions or restrictions are 
needed. An Application Schema shall be used whenever element contents extension is 
required, and should be used in most other cases to specify needed restrictions. That is, an 
Application Schema should be defined to extend and/or restrict elements as needed for a 
specific application, or a set of applications, to: 


a) Add elements to contents of existing elements, for recording additional data about 
that item needed for that application. 


b) Restrict the multiplicity of current contents elements, to eliminate flexibility not 
needed and perhaps confusing for that application. 


c) Use a different element name, to be more easily understood in that specific 
application, primarily for elements that will be instantiated many times. 


d) Specify standard contents and contents patterns for selected elements and attributes, 
as needed to improve interoperability. 


e) Specify standard XML and other documents to be referenced or otherwise used, as 
needed to improve interoperability. 


Application Schemas can thus be used for XML document contents extensions, 
restrictions, or both. Contents extension is expected to be often used to record additional 
data needed for applications. Contents restriction is expected to be frequently used to 
restrict contents, in order to increase interoperability and reduce ambiguity when greater 
flexibility is not needed for applications. Extensions of existing concrete elements can be 
defined by extending that concrete element. In many cases, restrictions of existing 
concrete elements can be done by extending the abstract element from which that 
concrete element is derived, by adding somewhat different but corresponding extensions.  


An Application Schema can specify a single top level element for use in an XML 
document, with the XML elements and types that it uses. That single top level XML 
element can be an object with identity, but this is not required. Such an Application 
Schema will import and build upon one or more of the six XML Schemas specified in 
this document. 


Application Schemas could define additional concrete elements using or extending other 
abstract elements, if needed. However, an additional concrete element using or extending 
an abstract element should not be defined if that concrete element is largely similar to an 







OGC 03-010r7 


10 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


existing element, and thus probably should extend or use an existing concrete element. In 
many cases, the existing concrete elements that use an abstract element are believed to be 
largely exhaustive. This is particularly true when the existing concrete elements include 
one element that is quite general, such as the elements EngineeringCRS, DerivedCRS, 
EngineeringDatum, UserDefinedCS, OperationParameter, and 
OperationParameterGroup. 


The Conversion, Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements 
can be used for well-known coordinate operation methods, especially when only one 
instance of that element is needed for that operation method. However, these elements 
should not be used for well-known coordinate operation methods when many instances of 
that element are needed for one operation method. Instead, an Application Schema that 
defines operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared for 
each such operation method. Subclauses F.3 and F.4 provide examples of such 
Application Schemas. For interoperability, a suitable geospatial information community 
should standardize each such Application Schema. 


NOTE  This use of Application Schemas follows the GML 3 patterns. This GML pattern is to generally 
use Application Schemas, especially when use of Application Schemas allows definition of XML Schema 
having: 1) complexTypes with more specific restrictions on the contents of elements, sometime in ways 
that allow XML parsers to more completely check for correct contents of XML documents, and 2) elements 
with more specific and understandable names, to make XML documents easier to understand by humans. 


6.4 Profiles 


Most Application Schemas and other uses of these CRS Schemas will use only a subset 
of the XML elements, types, and other capabilities defined in these CRS Schemas. Such a 
subset is termed a Profile, as specified in Subclause 7.16 of the GML 3 Implementation 
Specification. Briefly, a profile is a specified logical subset of the CRS Schemas plus the 
GML 3 schemas used with these CRS Schemas, selected to improve interoperability and 
reduce ambiguity. Such a profile should be specified by an Application Schema. 


6.5 Namespace and version 


All these XML Schema documents describe components in the 
http://www.opengis.net/gml namespace, for which the prefix "gml" is normally used. 


Each XML Schema document carries a version attribute as defined in the XML Schema 
Recommendation. The format of the version attribute string is x.yy where x denotes the 
major version number and yy denotes a minor version number for that document. The 
current version is 3.00. 


These XML Schemas use most of the GML 3 model and syntax specified in Subclause 
7.2.1 of the GML 3.00 specification. 







OGC 03-010r7

7 XML encoding 


The standard XML encoding of CRS and coordinate operation definition data is specified 
in six XML Schema documents (using the file extension .xsd). These six XML schema 
files are named: 


a) referenceSystems.xsd 


b) coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd 


c) datums.xsd 


d) coordinateSystems.xsd 


e) coordinateOperations.xsd 


f) dataQuality.xsd 


These XML schema files are listed in Annex C, and copies of these files are also attached 
to this document. These six XML schemas correspond to the six packages in the UML 
model that was converted. Each XML schema includes <documentation> elements that 
define the XML elements and attributes, largely copied from the UML model. 


These XML Schemas encoding CRS and coordinate operation definition data use nine 
XML schemas that are specified by GML 3. These XML schemas also include 
<documentation> elements that define the XML elements and attributes. Of course, these 
CRS Schemas use only some of the elements and types defined in these GML 3 schemas. 
These nine GML 3 schema documents are named: 


a) measures.xsd 


b) units.xsd 


c) geometryBasic2d.xsd 


d) geometryBasic0d1d.xsd 


e) temporal.xsd 
f) dictionary.xsd 


g) gmlBase.xsd 


h) basicTypes.xsd 


i) xlink.xsd

Annex A 
(normative) 


  
Conformance 


A.1 Conformance requirements 


Each OGC Implementation Specification that uses XML encoding to transfer data 
defining coordinate reference systems and/or coordinate operations shall transfer 
definition data that conforms to this Recommendation Paper. Each relevant data transfer 
situation specified by such a specification shall transfer data that contains the entire 
applicable subset of the definition data specified in this Paper. Each such data transfer 
should include any additional data needed. Each relevant OGC Implementation 
Specification shall clearly specify the contents, structure, and format of the XML 
encoded data transferred in each specified data transfer situation, usually partially 
specified as an Application Schema based on these CRS schemas. 


NOTE 1 In many cases, an Implementation Specification will specify the Application Programming 
Interface (API) to service software. In those cases, each specified data transfer situation is each input and 
output argument of each operation in a UML model of the service interface. Of course, multiple operation 
arguments will often transfer the same possible data, and thus use the same subset of the definition data 
specified here. Also, multiple arguments may use the same subset of the definition data specified here, 
although different arguments use different subsets of that data. 


NOTE 2 Many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can be used without 
Application Schemas, if no contents extensions or restrictions are needed. However, the Conversion, 
Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known 
coordinate operation methods having many element instances. Instead, an Application Schema that defines 
operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared and standardized, see 
Subclause 6.3. 


Whenever coordinate reference system and/or coordinate operation definition data is 
transferred using XML encoding, the data contents and structure specified herein shall be 
used wherever applicable. The data contents and structure aspects specified herein that 
shall be used include: 


a) Name of each specified XML element and attribute 


NOTE 3 When an Application Schema is used, the same name can be used in different namespaces. 


b) Meaning of each specified name 


c) Contents of each specified complexType 


d) Sequence of elements included within each specified complexType 


e) Multiplicity and optionality of each element and attribute in each specified 
complexType 


f) Data type of each specified individual data item 







OGC 03-010r7 


14 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


When a data transfer situation requires a subset of the definition information specified 
here, a suitable subset profile can be used. When a data transfer situation requires a 
superset of the definition information specified here, a suitable Application Schema shall 
be specified, and its' use shall be required. Each such Application Schema shall conform 
to the Rules for Application Schemas specified in Subclause A.3. The changes permitted 
in an Application Schema include: 


a) Add additional elements to a specified complexType, containing additional 
information 


b) Omit a specified element, when not needed and that element is specified as being 
optional (minOccurs="0") 


c) Remove some of the set of alternative elements in a specified <choice> data structure  


d) Make an optional element required (minOccurs not specified, default ="1") 


e) Reduce specified maximum number-of-repetitions of an element 


f) Change data type of an element to a more restrictive type 


g) Restrict the meaning of a specified name, to match a restriction of an Implementation 
Specification 


h) Specify standard contents and contents patterns for selected elements and attributes, 
for interoperability. 


i) Specify standard XML and other documents to be referenced or otherwise used, for 
interoperability. 


Many possible changes to the definition data specified here are not allowed, such as: 


a) Completely change the definition of a specified name 


b) Expand the set of alternative contents in a specified <choice> data structure 


c) Make optional an element or attribute required in a specified complexType 


d) Increase maximum number-of-repetitions of an element 


e) Change data type of a specified element to a less restrictive type 


f) Change the required order of elements in a specified complexType 


A.2 Abstract test suite 


Conformance of each application of these CRS Schemas shall be tested by inspecting the 
specification of each transferred XML encoded data structure and individual data item. 
The tested specification of XML encoded data shall include all Application Schemas 
used. This testing shall be done for each XML element and attribute that can be included 
in each specified data transfer. For each such XML element and attribute, the following 
questions shall be answered: 


a) What is the (complete) meaning of this XML element or attribute?

b) Is this meaning part of the definition of an XML element or attribute specified herein? 
If not related, this data structure or item IS conformant. 


c) Is this meaning similar to the meaning of any XML element or attribute specified 
herein? If not similar, this data structure or item IS conformant. 


d) Is this meaning the same as, or a restriction of, the most similar meaning specified 
herein? If not the same or restricted, this data structure or item is NOT conformant. 


e) Is the name of this XML element or attribute the same as the name of the 
corresponding item specified herein? If not the same name, this data structure or item 
is NOT conformant. 


f) Is the type of this XML element or attribute the same as the type of the corresponding 
item specified herein, a subtype of that type, or a type with all the relevant contents of 
that type? If the type is not the same or equivalent, this item is NOT conformant. 


If an individual XML element or attribute with a simpleType is being inspected, the 
questions continue: 


g) Is the data type of this item the same as, or a subset of, the data type of the 
corresponding item specified here? If not the same or a subset, this data item is NOT 
conformant. 


h) Does this element have a specified multiplicity range that extends outside the allowed 
multiplicity of the corresponding element specified here? If a larger multiplicity range 
is allowed, this element is NOT conformant. 


If a XML element with a complexType is being inspected, the questions continue: 


g) Do the contents of this complexType include all or a subset of the XML elements and 
attributes included in the corresponding complexType specified here? If doesn’t 
include all or a subset, this complexType is NOT conformant. 


h) Do the contents of this complexType include the corresponding XML elements in the 
same required order? If not the same order, this complexType is NOT conformant. 


i) If this complexType extends a complexType specified here, and the <documentation> 
element in that complexType specified here states constraints on inclusion of 
additional elements, and those constraints are not all satisfied, this complexType is 
NOT conformant. 


j) For each XML element or attribute included in this complexType that has a 
corresponding item in the complexType specified here, is the element or attribute 
multiplicity (including optionality) compatible? 


1) If the multiplicity and optionality are the same, this item IS conformant. 


2) If an element or attribute is now omitted instead of optional, this item IS 
conformant. 


3) If an element or attribute is now required instead of optional, this item IS 
conformant. 







OGC 03-010r7

4) If an element or attribute is now optional instead of required, this item is NOT 
conformant. 


5) If an element is now not repeated instead of being repeated one or more times, 
this item IS conformant. 


6) If an element can now be repeated instead of not being repeated, this item is 
NOT conformant. 


7) If the <documentation> element in the complexType specified here states a 
constraint on the multiplicity of this item and this constraint is not satisfied, this 
item is NOT conformant. 


A.3 Rules for application schemas 


A.3.1 Introduction 


An Application Schema is an XML Schema that imports and builds upon one or more of 
the CRS set of six XML Schemas specified in Annex C. Such a Schema defines one or 
more XML elements useful for transfer of encoded geospatial data. An Application 
Schema can specify a single top level element for use by an XML document, with the 
XML elements and types that it uses. That single top level XML element can be an object 
with identity, but this is not required. Such a Schema with its' imported Schemas defines 
a vocabulary for a particular domain of discourse by defining and describing the terms of 
that vocabulary (see ISO TC/211 19109). 


Conformance of an application of these CRS Schemas shall be tested by inspecting each 
Application Schema used, if any. Notice that the CRS set of XML Schemas specified in 
Annex C can be used without an Application Schema, and such use is allowed but 
discouraged. To use those XML Schemas without an Application Schema, any defined 
XML concrete element can be used as the basis for an XML document. There are about 
30 such concrete elements defined that may be directly useful, and are listed in Subclause 
6.2. In addition, all of those concrete elements can be used inside a GML 3 Dictionary 
element. Furthermore, all of those concrete elements or a Dictionary can be used inside a 
GenericMetaData element inside a metaDataProperty element, which can be included in 
many other elements. 


The remainder of this subclause specifies the requirements (or rules) for an Application 
Schema to be considered conformant with this Recommendation Paper. Notice that it is 
clearly possible to develop Application Schemas that use the CRS Schemas specified 
herein which are valid XML Schemas but do not follow all these rules, and are thus not 
conformant with this Recommendation Paper. 


A.3.2 General rules 


All conformant Application Schemas shall be constructed by building upon one or more 
of the CRS set of six XML Schemas specified in Annex C. Such a Schema shall be a 
valid XML Schema, as specified in the XML Schema specification. 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 17 
 


Each application schema must declare a target namespace. This is the namespace in 
which the XML elements or terms of the vocabulary “live”. This shall not be the GML 
namespace (http://www.opengis.net/gml). It is conventional for the namespace identifier 
to be a URL controlled by the application schema author’s organization. A target 
namespace is declared in the application schema using the targetNamespace attribute of 
the schema element from XML Schema. 


A.3.4 Import needed schemas 


An Application Schema must import the necessary XML Schemas specified in this 
document and from GML 3, with the correct namespace assignment. For example, in 
order to define coordinate reference systems, it is necessary to import 
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, either directly or indirectly. Direct import is done by 
including the declaration: 


<xsd:import namespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
schemaLocation="../coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd"/>


Notice that the <import> element specifies that the components described in 
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd are in the GML namespace 
http://www.opengis.net/gml. This namespace identifier must match the target namespace 
specified in the schema being imported, to ensure XML Schema validity. 


The schemaLocation of the imported .xsd file can be a local reference or a URI reference 
to the file. A URI reference can be to some remote repository, such as the repository 
http://schemas.opengis.net/ on the OGC web site. The above example assumes that the 
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd file is stored locally at a location relative to this 
Application Schemas .xsd file. 


Alternately, necessary XML Schemas can be imported indirectly, by importing another 
Application Schema that imports the needed Schemas. 


In addition, the required import of a GML schema may be provided by the import of an 
equivalent subset schema as described in Subclause 7.14 of the GML 3 Implementation 
Specification, or by the import of an equivalent schema from a GML profile. These are 
all equivalent schemas with respect to satisfying the schema import requirements. 


The above example imports coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd, which (directly and 
indirectly) includes the other five CRS Schemas plus nine other GML 3 Schemas. For 
some Application Schemas, coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd may not be needed, but one 
or more of the other CRS Schemas may be needed. 


A.3.5 GML objects and properties 


The content models of almost all (about 30) concrete elements listed in Subclause 6.2 are 
derived from gml:DefinitionType, partially by restriction. These elements are ultimately 
derived from the AbstractGMLType and are thus GML Objects. These elements shall thus 
follow the GML class/property model, as specified in Subclause 7.2.2 of the GML 3 
Implementation Specification. That is, the children of these elements must not be 







OGC 03-010r7 


18 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


elements whose content models derive directly or indirectly from AbstractGMLType. 
The children of these elements are properties that describe that component. 


A.3.6 Global and local names 


Note that elements included in complex types that are defined with local names in an 
Application Schema will prevent derivation by restriction in another namespace, unless 
the local names are dropped in the restriction. Such complex types are appropriate for 
elements intended for use “as is” in their own namespace, and should be declared to be 
final=”restriction”. Elements included in complex types by reference to global elements 
support derivation by restriction in another namespace, allowing restriction of cardinality, 
and/or replacement by a member of a substitution group. Such complex types designed 
for derivation by restriction are appropriate “library types” for elements in substitution 
groups that cross namespaces. 


A.4 UML models for application schemas 


Each Application Schema can be produced by converting a UML model (or part of such a 
model), as required to comply with ISO 19118. If such a UML model is encoded, the 
XML encoding rules used should be similar to the encoding rules used for this document, 
as described in Annex G. 


To comply with this specification, each such UML model shall be based on the same 
UML model as these CRS Schemas. For Application Schemas, subclasses can be defined 
for most non-abstract classes in this UML model. A subclass can extend and/or restrict a 
current concrete class to: 


a) Add UML attributes and/or navigable associations, for recording additional data 
about that class needed for that application. 


b) Restrict the multiplicity of current attributes and/or navigable associations, to 
eliminate flexibility not needed and perhaps confusing for that application. 


c) Use a different class name, to be more easily understood in that specific application, 
primarily for classes that will be instantiated many times. 


d) Specify standard or default contents for selected UML attributes, for interoperability. 


Application Schemas could define additional concrete subclasses of abstract classes in 
this UML model, if needed. However, additional concrete subclasses should not be 
defined that are largely similar to existing subclasses, and thus probably should be a 
subclass of an existing concrete subclass. In most cases, the existing concrete subclasses 
of an abstract class are believed to be largely exhaustive. This is particularly true when 
the existing subclasses include one subclass that is quite general, such as the classes 
SC_EngineeringCSR, SC_DerivedCRS, CD_EngineeringDatum, CS_UserDefinedCS, 
and CC_OperationParameter.

Annex B 
(informative) 


 
Expected uses of CRS definition data 


B.1 Introduction 


The expected OpenGIS uses (or use cases) for transferring CRS and coordinate operation 
definition data produce requirements to be satisfied by this XML encoding. Three broad 
uses of such definition data transfer have been identified: 


a) Use to transfer definition of a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), used by other 
geospatial data 


b) Use to transfer definition of a Coordinate Transformation (CT), that can be performed 
by a coordinate transformation service 


c) Use to transfer lineage or history of other geospatial data 


Additional OGC uses of the proposed CRS and coordinate operation definition data 
might be identified in the future. These expected OGC uses assume the OGC is 
standardizing software-to-software interfaces (or Application Programming Interfaces, 
APIs) and associated data transfer formats, but is not (currently) trying to standardize 
human-computer interfaces. 


Each OGC standard interface must allow both server and client software to be written 
that implements that interface. Simplicity of the interfaces is highly desirable, to simplify 
client software. Simplicity of server implementation software is somewhat important, but 
not as important as interface simplicity. 


The following subclauses first discuss the multiple uses of definition data, the alternate 
ways in which definition data can be transferred, and then the three data transfer uses 
listed above. 


B.2 Multiple uses of definition data 


CRS and CT definition data can be used in at least three broad overlapping ways, to: 


a) Describe a specific CRS or CT to a human user. Note that different human users need 
different degrees of definition detail. 


b) Uniquely identify a specific CRS or CT to software. For a CRS, such identification 
can be used by software to check if different geospatial datasets are recorded using 
the same CRS, or to find additional data about a CRS that is stored elsewhere. 


c) Provide data for performing coordinate transformations and conversions, useful to 
transformation software. For a CT, such data might be used to perform that 







OGC 03-010r7 


20 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


transformation. For a CRS, such data might be used in transforming point positions to 
or from that CRS. 


B.3 Alternative ways to transfer definition data 


CRS and CT definition data can be transferred in three alternative ways: 


a) Transfer only identifier and perhaps name, of each CRS or CT 


b) Transfer complete specification, of each CRS or CT 


c) Transfer partial specification with identifiers (and perhaps names) for remaining 
parts, of each CRS or CT 


Only an identifier needs to be transferred for a complete CRS or CT, or for any part 
thereof, for any part that is well-known to the receiving software. Well-known usually 
means that some recognized authority has produced and published a complete 
specification of that part. Server software could have those well-known definitions coded 
into the software. Alternately, server software could be coded to access those definitions 
when needed from a separate service known to the server. Such a separate service may be 
maintained by the authority or by a third party. 


In general, there will be several CRS and CT specification authorities that one server or 
client might use, separately and together. Of course, some software implementations may 
use no such authority, or only one such authority. One widely-used, publicly-available 
authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG), and use of this authority is 
currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. However, other and 
more private authorities exist and must be supported by some OGC standard interfaces, 
including military affiliated authorities (e.g., DIGEST). Somewhat private authorities are 
expected to be used for many engineering and image coordinate reference systems. 


A complete CRS or CT specification must be transferred for a CRS or CT, or for any part 
thereof, for any part that is not well-known to the receiving software. Some server or 
client implementations could support no well-known CRS and/or CT definitions. More 
likely, some applications are expected to use some non-well-known CRS or CT 
definitions. For example, a grid coverage can use a CRS specific to that coverage. Also, 
an image coordinate transformation is likely to be specific to one image, and may not be 
supported by any authority that makes that CRS or CT well-known. 


B.4 Use to transfer coordinate reference system definition 


XML can be used to transfer the definition of a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) used 
by other geospatial data, especially data encoded using XML. In most cases, one 
geospatial dataset will use only one CRS. The definition of a CRS for a geospatial dataset 
can be transferred (usually through an OGC interface) for several different purposes, 
including: 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 21 
 


a) Coordinate Transformation (CT) interface. The current Coordinate Transformation 
(CT) server interface allows use of XML to transfer definitions of CRSs. That is, a 
client can send the definition of one CRS that the client is requesting access, to server 
software. Similarly, the server software can send to a client the definition of one CRS 
that the client currently has access to. 


b) Geography Markup Language (GML). The encoding of features in XML, now 
specified in the GML Implementation Specification, might use this CRS XML to 
define the CRS of a feature collection or feature. 


c) Web Map Server (WMS) interface. A future version of the WMS interface might use 
XML to define the CRS that the client is requesting “map” data in. (The WMS 
interface does not currently use XML for this purpose.) In the current WMS interface, 
only well-known CRSs are supported, so only the identifier of that well-known CRS 
is transferred in a Get Map request. 


d) Grid Coverage (GC) interface. A future version of the GC (access) interface might 
use XML to define the CRS used by a coverage, when requested by a client. (The 
current GC interface does not use XML for this purpose.) In the current draft GC 
interface, the CRS can be defined for one specific grid coverage, requiring transfer of 
a more complete specification of that CRS. That grid CRS is usually specified as a 
custom affine coordinate conversion or  transformation from another CRS. 


B.4.1 Current CRS transfer by low-level CT interface 


The current low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification 
(OGC document 01-009) supports XML transfer of a CRS definition in one operation and 
in one attribute. 


The createFromXML operation of the CS_CoordinateSystemFactory <<Interface>> class 
creates a CS_CoordinateSystem object from a XML character string. One server will 
implement one CS_CoordinateSystemFactory object. The signature of this UML 
operation is: 


createFromXML (xml:CharacterString) : CS_CoordinateSystem


The “XML” read-only UML attribute of the CS_Info class allows a client to get an XML 
character string representation of an object, which can be either a CS_CoordinateSystem 
or a CS_Unit UML object. Objects of both the CS_CoordinateSystem and CS_Unit UML 
classes can be instantiated by multiple other objects visible to one client. Note that a 
CS_CoordinateSystem object can be created in several ways other than use of the 
createFromXML operation. The signature of this UML attribute is: 


XML : CharacterString


In the createFromXML operation, and when the UML attribute is used to get XML for a 
CS_CoordinateSystem object, the XML DTD for CS_CoordinateSystem provided in 
Section 15.1.1 (pages 113 through 115) of 00-007r4 is used. Example XML using that 
XML DTD is provided in Section 15.1.2 (pages 116 and 117) of 01-009. (Because that 
XML DTD and example XML are each more than one page, they are not copied here.) 







OGC 03-010r7 


22 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


NOTE  A future version of the Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification could 
use XML in additional places, especially where use of WKT is now supported but use of XML is not now 
supported. 


B.4.2 Current CRS transfer by ICT and high-level CT interfaces 


The current draft high-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation 
Specification (OGC document 01-013r1) supports XML transfer of a CRS definition by 
two operations. The same two operations are supported by the draft Image Coordinate 
Transformation (ICT) interface (OGC document 00-045r1). These two operations are 
provided to clients by the one Ground Coordinate Transformation Service <<Interface>> 
object. The UML operation signatures of these two operations are: 


addTransformation (metadata : TransformationMetadata,
format : TextFormat) : TransformationID


transformationMetadata (transformation : TransformationID,
format : TextFormat) : TransformationMetadata


XML is one possible format used by the Transformation Metadata <<DataType>> class 
that is used by these two operations. The Transformation Metadata class contains three 
UML attributes, with the signatures: 


sourceCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition
targetCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition
transformation [0..1]: TransformationDefinition


The CoordinateReferenceSystem XML element, with all its contents, specified in this 
document could to be used for each Coordinate System Definition instance in the 
Transformation Metadata. (However, the Transformation XML element specified in this 
document, with all their contents, alternately could be used for complete Transformation 
Metadata, including both the source and target CoordinateReferenceSystems.) 


B.5 Use to transfer coordinate transformation (CT) definition 


XML can be used to transfer the definition of a Coordinate Transformation (CT) in the 
interfaces to Coordinate Transformation (CT) services. These interfaces include the 
accepted (low level) CT Implementation Specification, OGC document 01-009. These 
interfaces also include a high-level CT interface now proposed in document 01-013, plus 
draft Image Coordinate Transformation interfaces documented in 00-045r1. These CT 
interfaces use XML to transfer CT definitions with and without associated source and 
target CRSs. 


B.5.1 Current CT transfer by low-level CT Interface 


The current low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification 
(OGC document 01-009) supports XML transfer of a CT definition in one operation and 
one attribute. 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 23 
 


The createFromXML operation of the CT_MathTransformFactory <<Interface>> class 
creates a CT_MathTransform object from a XML character string. One server will 
implement one CT_MathTransformFactory object. The UML signature of this operation 
is: 


createFromXML (xml:CharacterString) : CT_MathTransform


The “XML” read-only UML attribute of the CT_MathTransform class allows a client to 
get an XML character string representation of this UML object. Objects of the 
CT_MathTransform class can be instantiated by multiple UML objects visible to one 
client. Note that a CT_MathTransform object can be created in several ways other than 
use of the createFromXML operation. The signature of this UML attribute is: 


XML : CharacterString


For both of these XML uses, the XML DTD for CT_MathTransform provided in Section 
15.1.1 (page 113) of 01-009 is used. Example XML using that XML DTD is not provided 
in 01-009. The XML DTD for CT_MathTransform now in Section 15.1.1 is: 


<!DOCTYPE CT_MathTransform [
<!ELEMENT CT_MathTransform (


CT_ConcatenatedTransform |
CT_InverseTransform |
CT_ParameterizedMathTransform |
CT_PassThroughTransform) >


<!ELEMENT CT_ParameterizedMathTransform (CT_Parameter*)>
<!ATTLIST CT_ParameterizedMathTransform


ClassName CDATA #REQUIRED
>


<!ELEMENT CT_PassThroughTransform (CT_MathTransform)>
<!ATTLIST CT_PassThroughTransform

<!ELEMENT CT_InverseTransform (CT_MathTransform)>


<!ELEMENT CT_Parameter EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST CT_Parameter


Name CDATA #REQUIRED
Value CDATA #REQUIRED
>


]>


NOTE  This CT_MathTransform does not include any information on the source and target coordinate 
systems. Also, a future version of the low-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation 
Specification could use XML in additional places, especially where use of WKT is now supported but use 
of XML is not now supported.)

B.5.2 Current CT transfer by ICT and high-level CT interfaces 


The current draft high-level Coordinate Transformation (CT) interface specification 
(OGC document 01-013) supports XML transfer of a CT definition by two operations. 
The same two operations are supported by the draft Image Coordinate Transformation 
(ICT) interface (OGC document 00-045r1). These two operations are provided to clients 
by the one Ground Coordinate Transformation Service <<Interface>> object. The 
signatures of these two UML operations are: 


addTransformation (metadata : TransformationMetadata,
format : TextFormat) : TransformationID


transformationMetadata (transformation : TransformationID,
format : TextFormat) : TransformationMetadata


XML is one possible format used by the Transformation Metadata <<DataType>> class 
that is used by these two operations. The Transformation Metadata class contains three 
UML attributes, with the signatures: 


sourceCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition
targetCS : CoordinateSystemDefinition
transformation [0..1]: TransformationDefinition


The Transformation XML element specified in this document, with all their contents, 
could be used for a complete Transformation Metadata instance, including both the 
source and target CoordinateReferenceSystems. The Conversion XML element, with all 
its' contents probably can also be used for each Transformation Metadata instance. 


B.6 Use to transfer dataset lineage or history 


XML can be used to transfer the lineage or history of geospatial data, especially data encoded 
using XML. Such lineage information is specified by ISO 19115: Geographic 
information – Metadata to be part of the useful metadata about a dataset, and that 
metadata could be recorded in XML. (The OGC encourages use of ISO 19115 Metadata, 
but there are no uses of XML to transfer dataset lineage or history in current draft or 
accepted OGC Implementation Specifications.) 


The lineage of a dataset, or of a part of a larger dataset, is likely to include the original 
CRS of the positions in that data, plus the sequence of coordinate transformations used to 
change these positions into the CRS in which the data is now recorded. Alternately, one 
concatenated coordinate transformation could be recorded that includes the original CRS 
and the sequence of coordinate transformations used. Similar metadata might be recorded 
for data still in the original CRS, but planned to be converted into a different CRS.

Annex C 
(normative) 


 
XML schemas 


C.1 General 


This clause lists the six XML Schemas for encoding coordinate reference system and 
coordinate transformation definition data, namely: 


a) referenceSystems.xsd 


b) coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd 


c) datums.xsd 


d) coordinateSystems.xsd 


e) coordinateOperations.xsd 


f) dataQuality.xsd 


NOTE  The XML Schemas listed in this annex are directly copied from the XML Schema Document 
files attached to this document. If any differences are discovered, please notify the editor and the OGC. 


These XML Schemas include <documentation> elements for most of the XML Schema 
types defined, and for some of the XML elements defined. Where a XML element does 
not include a <documentation> element but the type it uses does, the type's 
<documentation> element applies to all the elements which use that type. These 
<documentation> elements specify the meaning of the corresponding XML elements and 
attributes. In addition, some <documentation> elements specify constraints on component 
elements and attributes. Most of the stated constraints are considered needed to fully 
comply with OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. All the contents of the 
<documentation> elements in these schemas are normative.

<conformance>This schema encodes the Reference System (RS_)
package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic
2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from
ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B
of Topic 2. The SC_CRS class is also encoded here, to eliminate the
(circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. The
RS_SpatialReferenceSystemUsingGeographicIdentifier class is not
encoded, since it is not applicable to coordinate positions. The
CI_Citation class is not directly encoded, since such information can
be included as metaDataProperty elements which are optionally allowed.
A modified version of the EX_Extent (DataType) class from ISO 19115 is
currently encoded here, using GML 3 schema types. (A more extensive
version of the EX_Extent package might be XML encoded in the future,
probably in a separate extent.xsd schema.) </conformance>

<documentation>A coordinate reference system consists of an
ordered sequence of coordinate system axes that are related to the
earth through a datum. A coordinate reference system is defined by one
datum and by one coordinate system. Most coordinate reference system do
not move relative to the earth, except for engineering coordinate
reference systems defined on moving platforms such as cars, ships,
aircraft, and spacecraft. For further information, see OGC Abstract
Specification Topic 2.


Coordinate reference systems are commonly divided into sub-types. The
common classification criterion for sub-typing of coordinate reference
systems is the way in which they deal with earth curvature. This has a
direct effect on the portion of the earth's surface that can be covered
by that type of CRS with an acceptable degree of error. The exception
to the rule is the subtype "Temporal" which has been added by analogy.

codeSpace attribute can be used to reference a source of more detailed
on this point or surface, or on a set of such descriptions.
- For a geodetic datum, this point is also known as the fundamental
point, which is traditionally the point where the relationship between
geoid and ellipsoid is defined. In some cases, the "fundamental point"
may consist of a number of points. In those cases, the parameters
defining the geoid/ellipsoid relationship have been averaged for these
points, and the averages adopted as the datum definition.
- For an engineering datum, the anchor point may be a physical point,
or it may be a point with defined coordinates in another CRS.
- For an image datum, the anchor point is usually either the centre of
the image or the corner of the image.
- For a temporal datum, this attribute is not defined. Instead of the
anchor point, a temporal datum carries a separate time origin of type
DateTime. </documentation>

refers to the year in which a major recalculation of the geodetic

Annex D 
(informative) 


 
Standard contents of code lists 


D.1 Introduction 


The XML Schemas specified in this document do not include definitions of the allowed 
values of the XML elements that encode the <<CodeList>> stereotyped classes specified 
in the UML model that was converted. Those XML elements are: 


a) derivedCRSType, in coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd 


b) pixelInCell, in datums.xsd 


c) verticalDatumType, in datums.xsd 


Those XML elements are each required to include a "codeSpace" attribute with type 
"anyURI". The value of that attribute must reference a source of information specifying 
the values and meanings of all the allowed string values for this element. An Application 
Schema is expected to specify such a source of information, and how that source shall be 
referenced, whenever that Application Schema uses an XML element converted from a 
<<CodeList>> stereotyped class. 


This annex specifies the standard set of string values and their meanings for each of the 
three XML elements listed above. This annex first specifies one possible XML Schema 
for encoding a standard set of string values and their meanings in an XML document. 
That possible application schema is then used to record each of the three standard sets of 
string values and their meanings. 


D.2 XML schema for code lists 


An XML document can be used to encode all the allowed string values with their 
meanings for an XML element that encodes one <<CodeList>> stereotyped UML class. 
One possible XML Schema for encoding such a standard set of string values and their 
meanings is: 


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Annex E 
(informative) 


 
XML document examples 


E.1 Introduction 


This annex provides example XML documents using the XML schemas specified in this 
document. These examples include both identification and specification data for many 
geospatial entities. These XML examples omit some optional XML elements and 
attributes that might be included, and include some optional elements and attributes that 
might be omitted. This omission or inclusion was partially based on whether reasonable 
values were known for optional elements and attributes. The optional elements that are 
omitted in these examples XML include: 


a) The “remarks” element in all IdentifierType and object elements. 


b) The "scope" element in all elements that could include it. 


Most of these XML examples assume that the XML Schemas specified in Annex C are 
accessible using the location coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. These XML examples use 
patterns that are not specified in this document for values of the "gml:id", "gml:uom", 
"xlink:href", and "xlink:title" XML attributes. 


EDITOR'S NOTE  Some of the patterns now used for values of these attributes may be invalid or 
inappropriate. I urge reviewers to suggest any needed or desirable improvements. 


NOTE  For interoperability, the patterns or formats used for the values of these attributes must be 
specified somewhere, normally in or with an Application Schema. 


E.2 Example XML for geographic 2D coordinate reference system 


This subclause provides an example XML document using the Coordinate Reference 
System subtype GeographicCRS XML element, with its’ contained elements, applied to a 
geographic 2D coordinate system. This example XML is applicable to the current low-
level Coordinate Transformation (CT) Implementation Specification, document 01-009.

Again, the above example XML just references the units #degree, #metre, and #one (a 
scale factor unit). Definitions of those units could be included in this XML document by 
adding a Dictionary element in a metaDataProperty of this CompoundCRS. This could be 
done in the same manner as shown in the second example XML document in Subclause 
E.2. 


E.4 Simple example XML for compound coordinate reference system 


The example XML document in the previous subclause includes many elements and 
attributes that are optional, and can thus be omitted when not needed. This subclause 
provides a simplified example XML document for the same 3D compound coordinate 
reference system, which omits most of the optional elements and attributes. This 
simplified example XML is intended to be adequate when the Projected CRS and the 
Vertical CRS are both well-known. That is, this simplified example assumes that server 
software can obtain the coordinate reference system specification and other data for these 
two coordinate reference systems using only the given "xlink:href" attribute values.

E.5 Example XML for Transverse Mercator conversion 


This subclause provides an example XML document using the Coordinate Operation 
concrete subtype "Conversion" XML element, with its' contained elements, applied to an 
example Transverse Mercator map projection. 


NOTE  Subclause F.3.4 provides a corresponding example XML document using the example 
Transverse Mercator map projection XML Schema provided in Subclause F.3.3. That encoding of 
Transverse Mercator conversions is recommended, since multiple instances of the Transverse Mercator 
type of conversion are expected.

E.9 Referencing a coordinate reference system 


The coordinate reference system (CRS) used by coordinates is referenced in the geometry 
XML elements defined by GML, and in a number of other places. GML 2 was limited to 
use of only well-known CRSs, so this reference to a CRS was abbreviated by a single 
attribute name and value, such as: 


srsName=”EPSG:4326”


GML 3 still uses the srsName attribute, with type xsd:anyURI. This srsName can still be 
”EPSG:4326”, or it can be a pointer to a more complete CRS definition stored 
somewhere else. That somewhere else could be any of several places, including: 


a) Outside the XML document where it is referenced, such as: 


1) In a dictionary of multiple CRS definitions available electronically from a 
specified URL. In this case, the srsName attribute could reference the dictionary, 
and the specific item in that dictionary. 


2) In a dictionary of multiple CRS definitions not available electronically. 
However, the srsName attribute could still reference the dictionary, and the 
specific item in that dictionary. 


3) In a catalog or registry service which stores CRS definitions, probably available 
electronically. In this case, the srsName attribute could reference the service, and 
the specific item available from that service. (The value ”EPSG:4326” can be 
considered to be a reference to the EPSG registry of CRS definitions.) 


b) Inside the XML document where it is referenced, such as: 


1) In a dictionary of one or more CRS definitions stored as metadata in some XML 
element in that XML document. (Storing a dictionary of units as metadata is 
discussed in Subclause E.2.) 


2) As one or more CRS definitions included in some XML element specified by an 
Application Schema based on the GML and/or CRS schemas. 


In all cases listed above, the remote CRS definition could be XML encoded as specified 
in this document. For example, a XML encoded dictionary of CRS definitions could be 
similar to the units Dictionary example given in Subclause E.7. When the CRS definition 
is stored outside the XML document where it is referenced (item a) above), the remote 
CRS definition would not need to be encoded in XML. 


E.10 Example XML for image CRS 


This subclause provides an example XML document using the ImageCRS element from 
the coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd schema, with its’ contained elements, applied to an 
image coordinate reference system that might be used for most 2D images.

Annex F 
(informative) 


 
Application schema examples 


F.1 Introduction 


This annex provides several example Application Schemas based on these CRS Schemas, 
each with a corresponding example XML document using that Application Schema plus 
the example UML model from which that Application Schemas was converted. For more 
information on Application Schemas, see Subclauses 6.3 and A.4. 


These XML examples use patterns that are not specified in this document for values of 
the "gml:id", "gml:uom", "xlink:href", and "xlink:title" XML attributes. 


EDITOR'S NOTE  Some of the patterns now used for values of these attributes may be invalid or 
inappropriate. I urge reviewers to suggest any needed or desirable improvements. 


NOTE  For interoperability, the patterns or formats used for the values of these attributes must be 
specified somewhere, normally in or with the Application Schema. 


F.2 Extended operation method definition 


F.2.1 Introduction 


Multiple needs are expected for encoding additional information describing coordinate 
reference systems and their components. This subclause provides an example of such 
extended encoding, applied to Operation Methods and Operation Parameters. The 
following subclauses contain: 


a) A draft class diagram of a UML package for an Extended Operation Method, which 
builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6. 


b) A draft XML Schema for encoding an Extended Operation Method, produced by 
converting this UML package. 


c) A XML encoding of the possible contents of the <<CodeList>> stereotyped 
ParameterType class in this UML package. 


d) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an 
Extended Operation Method  


F.2.2 UML package 


Figure F.1 is a class diagram of an example UML package for an Extended Operation 
Method. This UML package builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6.

F.2.3 Application schema 


This subclause contains an example XML Schema for encoding an Extended Operation 
Method, produced by converting the above UML package. This XML Schema builds on 
the coordinateOperations.xsd XML Schema contained in Subclause C.6. This draft XML 
Schema is written following the same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 XML encoding 
rules as used in the XML Schemas in Annex C. This draft XML Schema is written as an 
Application Schema in a different namespace. 


This example XML Schema is:

F.3 Transverse Mercator conversion 


F.3.1 Introduction 


Standardized XML encoding is needed for a number of specific commonly-used types of 
coordinate conversions and transformations. This subclause provides an example of one 
such encoding, applied to one commonly-used conversion type, namely the Transverse 
Mercator map projection. The following subclauses contain: 


a) A draft class diagram of a UML package for the Transverse Mercator type of map 
projection, which builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6. 


b) A draft XML Schema for encoding a Transverse Mercator projection, produced by 
converting this UML package. 


c) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an 
example Transverse Mercator map projection 


F.3.2 UML package 


Figure F.2 is a draft class diagram of a UML package for Transverse Mercator map 
projections. This class diagram is incomplete in that many of the needed association role 
names and multiplicities are not shown due to lack of space. This UML package builds 
on the UML model in document 03-009r6.

F.3.3 Application schema 


This subclause contains an example XML Schema for encoding a Transverse Mercator 
projection, produced by converting the above UML package. This XML Schema builds 
on the coordinateOperations.xsd XML Schema contained in Subclause C.6. This draft 
XML Schema is written following the same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 XML 
encoding rules as used in the XML Schemas in Annex C. This draft XML Schema is 
written as an application schema in a different namespace. Of course, it could be 
rewritten as an additional XML Schema in the GML namespace, and would be similar. 


EDITORS NOTE:  In this draft XML Schema, I included documentation element text based on my limited 
understanding of the Transverse Mercator map projection. I urge John Bobbitt, Roel Nicolai, and others to 
suggest improvements in the wording of these documentation elements. 


This draft XML Schema is:

F.4 Universal image geometry model transformation 


F.4.1 Introduction 


Standardized XML encoding is needed for a number of frequently-used types of image 
coordinate transformations. This subclause provides an example of one such encoding, 
applied to an example image coordinate transformation. That example type of image 
coordinate transformation is the one described in Section 6.5 of OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 7: The Earth Imagery Case, namely the Universal Image Geometry 
Model (UIGM). That UIGM transformation is from a 3D ground coordinate reference 
system to a 2D image coordinate reference system, and has been simplified here for 
brevity. The following subclauses contain: 


a) A draft class diagram of a UML package for this simplified UIGM transformation, 
which builds on the UML model in document 03-009r6. 


b) Two draft XML Schemas for encoding this simplified UIGM transformation, 
produced by converting this UML package. 


c) An example XML document based on this draft XML Schema for encoding an 
example UIGM transformation, plus an example XML document based on the 
Application Schema in Subclause F.2.3 for encoding the Operation Method used by 
this UIGM transformation. 


F.4.2 UML package 


Figures F.3 to F.7 contain the five parts of a draft class diagram of a UML package for 
this simplified UIGM transformation. Figure F.3 shows the top level of the class diagram, 
without showing the components of the SectionParametersGroup and 
MonoscopicErrorsGroup. This diagram is incomplete in that some of the needed 
association role names and multiplicities are not shown due to lack of space. Figure F.4 
shows the top level within the SectionParametersGroup, without showing the components 
of the NormalizationParametersGroup and PolynomialGroup. Figure F.5 shows one 
example parameter value in the NormalizationParametersGroup, with a note listing the 
other nine parameter values. Figure F.6 shows two example parameter values in the 
PolynomialGroup, with a note listing the six other parameter values. Figure F.7 shows the 
complete contents of the MonoscopicErrorsGroup.

F.4.3 Application schemas 


This subclause contains example XML Schemas for encoding this simplified UIGM 
transformation, produced by converting the above UML package. These XML Schemas 
build on the coordinateOperations.xsd contained in Subclause C.6. These draft XML

Model for one image. </scope>
<description>Example Application Schema to encode ground-to-


image coordinate transformation data for a specific image, using the
Universal Image Geometry Model type of coordinate transformation as
described in Section 6.5 of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 7 : The
Earth Imagery Case (OGC document 99-107). This example does not encode
data for the image correction tables, stereoscopic position error
estimates, and most information not used by the image geometry model.
Builds on coordinateOperations.xsd and typedValues.xsd, and follows
same GML 3 patterns and ISO 19118 encoding. Written in the "ex"
namespace. Primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2003/03/31.

<conformance>This schema encodes a draft UIGM package that
builds on the Coordinate Operation (CC_) package of the extended UML
Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by
Coordinates. That draft package defines restricted subtypes of the
CC_Transformation, CC_ParameterValue, and CC_ParameterValueGroup
classes as needed for the UIGM transformation. </conformance>

The above XML example uses dummy values such as "Aaaa" in place of real values for 
some text string values. Similarly, this example also uses dummy values such as "99.99" 
in place of real values for some numerical values. This example assumes that the 
Application Schemas specified in Subclause F.4.3 are accessible using the location 
UIGM1transformation.xsd. 


The above XML example also assumes that (complete) information for several items is 
available elsewhere. The definition of the sourceCRS and targetCRS are assumed to be 
available elsewhere, and can be encoded in XML as shown in the example XML in 
Subclauses E.3 and E.10. The definition of the simplified UIGM OperationMethod can 
be XML encoded using the example Application Schema from Subclause F.2.3, and 
could be:

<!-- Primary editor: Arliss Whiteside. Last updated 2003/03/10. -->
<gml:remarks>This operation method implements the universal image


geometry model that transforms ground coordinates into georeferenced
image coordinates. This image geometry model uses one ratio of two
polynomial functions to compute the row image coordinate, and uses a
similar ratio of two different polynomials to compute the column image
coordinate. All four polynomials are functions of three ground
coordinates: two horizontal coordinates and one vertical coordinate. In
the polynomial functions, the three ground coordinates and two image
coordinates are each offset and scaled to have a range from -1.0 to
+1.0 over an image or image section. For brevity, this simplified
operation method specification does not include all geometry model
parameters or all optional XML elements. </gml:remarks>

Annex G 
(informative) 


 
UML to XML schemas conversion process 


G.1 General 


This document describes an application of ISO 19118 Annex A "XML based encoding 
rule" to a UML model of Coordinate Reference System and Coordinate Operation 
definition data. The UML model converted to XML Schemas is based on OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates (OGC 02-102). That UML 
model has been expanded and revised, to improve it and to slightly better support 
conversion to XML Schemas. That revised UML model is intended to replace the UML 
model now in Topic 2, and is currently documented in OGC document 03-009r6. 


This conversion to XML Schemas was done in a manner that makes the results consistent 
with GML 3.0. Therefore, many of the details of many of the encoding rules used were 
adapted to produce XML Schemas consistent with the GML 3 schema patterns, and to 
use some of the XML elements and types defined in the GML 3 schemas. 


NOTE  Many of the GML 3 schema patterns are described in Subclauses 6.4, 7.1, 7.2. 8.1 through 8.3, 
and 8.6 of the GML 3.00 Implementation Specification. 


This annex lists the "rules" used in this UML model to XML Schemas conversion 
process. Those rules are described in the following subclauses, for converting UML: 


a) Packages 
b) Classes 
c) Attributes 
d) Associations 
e) Multiplicities 
f) Other 


G.2 Rules for packages 


The rules used to convert UML model packages to XML Schemas were: 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 169
 


Rule 1  Convert each UML package into a separate XML Schema Document. Name each 
XML Schema Document like the UML package, with spaces removed, the first 
character changed to lower case, and the word "System" made plural. 


Example UML package name: Coordinate Reference System 
XML Schema name: coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd 


Reason(s) Produce multiple (i.e., 6) XML Schema documents (not one), following GML 
patterns. 


Exceptions None 
 







OGC 03-010r7 


170 © OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 
 


Rule 2  Begin each XML Schema Document with standard header information. 
Example <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 


<schema targetNamespace="http://www.opengis.net/gml" 
xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" 
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" elementFormDefault="qualified"

   <name>coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd</name> 
   <version>3.0</version> 
   <scope>How to encode coordinate reference system definitions. </scope> 
   <description>Builds on referenceSystems.xsd to encode the data needed to

   <conformance>This schema encodes the Coordinate Reference System 
(SC_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: 
Spatial Referencing by Coordinates, with the exception of the abstract "SC_CRS" 
class. The "SC_CRS" class is encoded in referenceSystems.xsd, to eliminate the 
(circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to 
coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - 
Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex B of Topic 2.

</schema> 


Reason(s) Produce XML Schema Documents that follow GML patterns. 
Exceptions None 
 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 171
 


Rule 3  Include "xsd:include" statements in each XML Schema Document as needed for 
other XML Schema Documents referenced. 


Example [In coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd:] 
 <include schemaLocation="coordinateSystems.xsd"/> 
 <include schemaLocation="datums.xsd"/> 
 <include schemaLocation="coordinateOperations.xsd"/> 


Reason(s) Produce valid XML Schema Documents. 
Exceptions None 
 
Rule 4  Remove suffix containing two-letter UML package abbreviation plus following 


underscore character from class names, as classes and attribute data types are 
converted to XML Schema elements. 


Example UML class name: SC_GeographicCRS 
XML element name: GeographicCRS 


Reason(s) Produce XML: Schema element names following the GML pattern. 
Exceptions None 
 
Rule 5  Encode EX_Extent UML class in referenceSystems.xsd, based on specification of 


that class in ISO 19115 but using relevant GML 3 complexTypes. 
Example Not applicable 
Reason(s) Not create another XML Schema document, for a short XML encoding 
Exceptions None 
 
Rule 6  Move XML encoded version of SC_CRS class to referenceSystems.xsd from 


coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd 
Example Move _CRS element, crsRef element, and related complexTypes. 
Reason(s) Remove prohibited circular reference between coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd and 


coordinateOperations.xsd. (TBR) 
Exceptions None 
 


G.3 Rules for classes 


The rules used to convert UML model classes to XML Schemas were: 


NOTE  Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML class into a <documentation> 
element of the XML complexType or element converted from this UML class attribute, in order to keep the 
UML class documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas. 







OGC 03-010r7

Rule 7  Convert each UML class with <<DataType>> stereotype to XML Schema global 
declaration of complexType, with same name augmented with "Type" suffix and with 
<documentation> element copying documentation of UML class. 


Example UML class:  


 


DQ_CovarianceElement
+ rowIndex : Integer
+ columnIndex : Integer
+ covariance : Double


<<DataType>>


 
XML Schema: 
 <complexType name="CovarianceElementType"> 
  <annotation> 
   <documentation>An element of a covariance matrix.</documentation> 
  </annotation> 
  <sequence> 
   [Insert here XML elements encoding UML attributes] 
  </sequence> 
 </complexType> 
 <-- =================================================== --> 


Reason(s) Use XML Schema global complexType, with names following GML patterns. 
Exceptions a) Do not XML encode CI_Citation class, since such information can be included 


as metaDataProperty elements, which are optionally allowed.  
b) XML encode EX_Extent class in referenceSystems.xsd. 


Applies to UML classes: RS_Identifier, DQ_CovarianceElement, EX_Extent, CI_Citation

following complexType. 
b) complexType with same name augmented with "Type" suffix, with standard 


contents for a <<CodeList>> class except including <documentation> element 
copying documentation of UML class.

declarations of: 
a) element with same name except first letter not capitalized, and having the 


following complexType. 
b) complexType with same name augmented with "Type" suffix, containing a 


<choice> construct and <documentation> element copying documentation of 
UML class.

shape of an ellipsoid. An ellipsoid requires two defining parameters: semi-major axis 
and inverse flattening or semi-major axis and semi-minor axis. When the reference 
body is a sphere rather than an ellipsoid, only a single defining parameter is required, 
namely the radius of the sphere; in that case, the semi-major axis "degenerates" into 
the radius of the sphere.</documentation> 
  </annotation>

G.4 Rules for attributes 


The rules used to convert UML model (class) attributes to XML Schemas were: 


NOTE 1 Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML attribute into a <documentation> 
element of the XML element converted from this UML attribute, in order to keep the UML attribute 
documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas. 


NOTE 2 Most of these rules use global XML elements (instead of local elements inside another element) 
for flexibility. Use of global elements allows Application Schemas in another namespace to restrict tan 
element containing only global elements.

G.5 Rules for associations 


Most rules used to convert UML model (class) associations to XML Schemas are 
separately applied to each navigable end of each association. The rules used were: 


Rule 45  Do not XML encode the non-navigable ends of UML associations (usually without 
role names) 


Example None 
Reason(s) There is no need to navigate association in this direction. 
Exceptions None 
Applies to UML association role names: None 
 
Rule 46  Do not XML encode the ends of UML "derived" associations. 
Example UML role name:  +usesDatum from SC_CoordinateReferenceSystem class 


XML Schema: (None) 
Reason(s) There is no need to navigate derived associations (instead of the basic associations). 
Exceptions None 
Applies to UML association role names:  
 
The following rules for encoding associations apply to only the navigable end (always 
has a role name) of non-derived UML associations: 


NOTE  Most of these rules copy the documentation of each UML association role into a 
<documentation> element of the XML element converted from this UML role, in order to keep the UML 
association role documentation for human understanding of the XML Schemas. 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 211
 


Rule 47  Convert each navigable end of each composition UML association to XML Schema 
declarations of: 
a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> construct of the complexType 


converted from the class at the other end of this association. 
b) Global element with same name, using the complexType encoded for the class at 


this end of the association, and with <documentation> element copying 
documentation of this UML role name. 


Example UML role name:  +usesValue from CC_Operation class 
XML Schema: Inside <sequence> construct: 
  <element ref="gml:usesValue" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 
Global element declaration: 
 <element name="usesValue" type="gml:ParameterValueType"> 
  <annotation> 
   <documentation>Unordered list of composition associations to the set of 
parameter values used by this conversion operation. </documentation> 
  </annotation> 
 </element> 
 <!-- =================================================== --> 


Reason(s) Follow GML pattern for properties. Define global element for flexibility. 
Exceptions None 
Applies to UML association role names: +usesValue from CC_Operation, +includesValue from 


CC_ParameterValueGroup, +includesElement from DQ_CovarianceMatrix 
 







OGC 03-010r7

Rule 48  Convert each navigable end of each aggregation of unspecified type of UML 
association to XML Schema declarations of: 
a) Reference to following element inside <sequence> construct of the complexType 


converted from the class at the other end of this association. 
b) Global element with same name, using the "xxxxRefType" encoded for the class 


at this end of this association, and with <documentation> element copying 
documentation of this UML role name. 


Example UML role name:  +usesEllipsoid from CD_GeodeticDatum class 
XML Schema: Inside <sequence> construct: 
  <element ref="gml:usesEllipsoid"/> 
Global element declaration: 
 <element name="usesEllipsoid" type="gml:EllipsoidRefType"> 
  <annotation> 
   <documentation>Association to the ellipsoid used by this geodetic datum. 
</documentation> 
  </annotation> 
 </element> 
 <!-- =================================================== --> 


Reason(s) Use "xxxxRefType" following GML pattern for general associations. Define global 
element for flexibility. 


Exceptions a) If new global element declaration would be a duplicate, do not duplicate it. 
b) If association has attached {XOR} note, see following rule. 
c) For all +usesDatum role names to concrete classes for specific types of datums, 


change XML element name from "usesDatum' to the class name on this end of 
the association prefixed by "uses". 


d) For all +usesCS role names to concrete classes for specific types of coordinate 
systems, change XML element name from "usesCS' to the class name on this end 
of the association prefixed by "uses". 


e) For +usesOperation from CC_ConcatenatedOperation, change XML element 
name from "usesOperation" to " usesSingleOperation". 


Applies to UML association role names: +includesCRS from SC_CompoundCRS, +baseCRS 
from SC_GeneralDerivedCRS, +usesDatum from SC_GeocentricCRS, +usesDatum 
from SC_GeographicCRS, +usesDatum from SC_VerticalCRS, +usesDatum from

Rule 49  Convert each navigable end of an aggregation UML association with attached 


{XOR} note to XML Schema declarations of a reference to the appropriate element. 
Put this element inside a <choice> construct and without minOccurs="0", inside the 
<sequence> construct of the complexType converted from the class at the other end 
of this association. 


Example UML role name:  +usesSphericalCS from SC_GeocentricCRS class 
 and   +usesCartesianCS from SC_GeocentricCRS class

     <choice> 
      <element ref="gml:usesCartesianCS"/> 
      <element ref="gml:usesSphericalCS"/> 
     </choice> 
 


Reason(s) Take advantage of <choice> construct in XML Schema. 
Exceptions If new global element declaration would be a duplicate, do not duplicate it. 
Applies to UML association role names: +usesSphericalCS from SC_GeocentricCRS, 


+usesCartesianCS from SC_GeocentricCRS, +usesCartesianCS from SC_ImageCRS, 
+usesObliqueCartesianCS from SC_ImageCRS 


 


G.6 Rules for multiplicities 


The rules used to convert UML model multiplicities to XML Schemas were: 


Rule 50  Convert each UML multiplicity "0..*", on UML attributes and navigable association 
role names, to XML Schema declaration of minOccurs="0" 
maxOccurs="unbounded". 


Example UML model multiplicity:     0..* 
XML Schema element multiplicity:   minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" 


Reason(s) Use relevant XML Schema multiplicity constructs. 
Exceptions None 
 
Rule 51  Convert each UML multiplicity "1..*", on UML attributes and navigable association 


roles, to XML Schema declaration of maxOccurs="unbounded". 
Example UML model multiplicity:     1..* 


XML Schema element multiplicity:   maxOccurs="unbounded" 
Reason(s) Use relevant XML Schema multiplicity construct.

Annex H 
(informative) 


 
Coordinate operation methods 


H.1 Introduction 


This annex contains a non-exhaustive description of some conversion and transformation 
operation methods. It lists a number of methods defined in the EPSG v 6.3 well-known 
data set, plus a few other often used methods and some methods applicable to the 
transformation of image coordinates. 


Each operation method should uniquely specify the algorithm to be used for a coordinate 
transformation. This specification may comprise two algorithms, forward and inverse, as 
is sometimes used for map projection algorithms. Each conversion and transformation, 
and each operation method, should use a well-known data set in referencing such 
algorithms. 


NOTE  Of course, referencing a well-known algorithm does not imply that software which implements 
these algorithms has correctly implemented it, or has implemented all referenced algorithms. Similarly, 
referencing a well-known set of parameter values does not imply that software which implements these 
values uses the correct values. 


H.2 EPSG defined operation methods 


The well-known data set from EPSG (version 6.3) specifies a number of operation 
methods. Please note that the EPSG data set is neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive. This 
document lists a subset of the methods in the EPSG data set. Methods not listed in this 
document, but listed in the EPSG data set, can easily be implemented using the 
OperationMethod and OperationParameter elements, making use of the method name and 
parameter names specified in the EPSG data set. 


These operation methods are defined making use of well-defined operation parameters. 
When a coordinate operation is specified referencing an EPSG defined operation method, 
the detailed specification in an XML document should adhere to the EPSG definitions of 
the operation parameters. 


The detailed definition of these operation method algorithms, with their formulas and a 
worked example is included in the EPSG data set, available on the Web, through the 
reflector: http://www.epsg.org/ 


These and other information on coordinate operation methods is available on: 
http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/

H.3. Other operation methods  


H.3.1 Introduction 


The following operation methods are not specified in any well-known data set but are 
implied in the specification of Coordinate Systems and Coordinate Reference Systems. 


a) Polar / Cartesian (2D) conversion 


b) Spherical / Cartesian (3D) conversion 


c) Cylindrical / Cartesian conversion 


d) Linear to Cartesian (2D) conversion 


e) Linear to Cartesian (3D) conversion 


f) Geographic3D to Geographic2D/GravityRelatedHeight conversion 


 
H.3.2 Polar / Cartesian (2D) conversion 


This method converts two-dimensional polar coordinates to plane Cartesian coordinates 
and vice versa (the inverse algorithm is implied in this transformation method). 


H.3.3 Spherical / Cartesian (3D) conversion  


This method converts spherical coordinates (sometimes referred to as polar 3D 
coordinates) to 3D Cartesian coordinates and vice versa (the inverse algorithm is again 
implied in this transformation method). Please bear in mind that when the spherical 
coordinate system is used in a local context (i.e., in an EngineeringCRS); the converted 
Cartesian coordinate system can only be used in the same context: there is no datum 
change involved. Transformation to a Geocentric Cartesian system is possible only when 
the spherical coordinate system is also geocentric.  


H.3.4 Cylindrical / Cartesian conversion 


This method converts (3D) cylindrical coordinates to 3D Cartesian coordinates and vice 
versa. The area of use of the cylindrical coordinate system is unlikely to be other than 
local. The Cartesian coordinate system will therefore also be associated with an 
EngineeringCRS. A further (or indeed a one-step) transformation to a Geocentric system 
will be incorrect, although it may seem mathematically correct.

H.4 Image coordinate transformation methods  


H.4.1 Introduction 


This subclause discusses the following non-exhaustive list of coordinate transformation 
types applicable to image coordinate reference systems:  


a) Ground-to-image transformations 


b) Single-image-to-ground transformations 


c) Elevation coverage with single-image-to-ground transformations 


d) Elevation coverage for 2D to 3D coordinate transformations 


e) Elevation coverage with single ground-to-image transformations 
 
H.4.2 Ground-to-image transformations 


This set of operation methods defines transformations used for ground-to-image 
coordinate transformations, with one method used for each image geometry model type. 
The input to such a transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the output is 
usually 2D image coordinates. These methods will usually use parameters for directly 
transforming 3D ground coordinates to 2D image coordinates. 


 
H.4.3 Single-image-to-ground transformations 


This set of operation methods defines transformations used for single (or monoscopic) 
image-to-ground transformations, with one operation method used for each image 
geometry model type. These methods could use parameters for directly transforming 2D 
image coordinates to multiple 3D ground coordinates. However, these parameterized 
transformations could use parameters for directly transforming 3D ground coordinates to 
2D image coordinates (like ground-to-image transformations). 


The output from such a transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the input 
can be compound 2D image plus 3D ground coordinates. In that case, the 3D ground 
coordinates are used to provide a fixed elevation value, to be used with the 2D image 
input coordinates. The horizontal position is included with each elevation to facilitate 
ground coordinate transformations. Inclusion of the horizontal position also allows the 
client to provide an approximate horizontal ground position, when known. Server 
software implementing such transformations is allowed to make use of this approximate 
horizontal position, to speed computation. 


 
H.4.4 Elevation coverage with single-image-to-ground transformation 


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage with a 
single-image-to-ground transformation. One operation method can be used for any 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 219
 


elevation coverage that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A 
transformation parameter should reference one elevation coverage from one external 
elevation coverage service. This assumes that interface implementations will first use a 
separate single-image-to-ground transformation to compute two or more points along the 
image ray. The implementation will then intersect this ray with ground shape defined by 
elevation coverage. 


The output from this transformation is usually 3D ground coordinates, and the input can 
be compound 2D image plus 3D ground coordinates (plus the separately specified 
elevation coverage). In that case, the input 3D ground coordinates are used to provide an 
approximate elevation value, to be used with the 2D image input coordinates. The 
horizontal position is included with each elevation to facilitate ground coordinate 
transformations. Inclusion of the horizontal position also allows the client to provide an 
approximate horizontal ground position, when known. Server software implementing 
such transformations is allowed to make use of this approximate horizontal position, to 
speed computation. 


 
H.4.5 Elevation coverage for 2D to 3D coordinate transformation 


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage for 2D to 3D 
coordinate transformations. One operation method can be used for any elevation coverage 
that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A transformation parameter 
should reference one elevation coverage from one external elevation coverage service. 
The input to this transformation is 2D horizontal coordinates (plus the separately 
specified elevation coverage), and the output is 3D coordinates. This transformation can 
be used in a Concatenated Transformation with a ground-to-image transformation, to go 
from 2D ground coordinates to 2D image coordinates. 


 
H.4.6 Elevation coverage with single ground-to-image transformation 


This operation method defines a transformation using an elevation coverage with a single 
ground-to-image transformation. One operation method can be used for any elevation 
coverage that uses the same OGC specified (grid) coverage interface. A transformation 
parameter should reference one elevation coverage from one external elevation coverage 
service. The input to this transformation is 2D horizontal ground coordinates (plus the 
separately specified elevation coverage), and the output is usually 2D image coordinates. 
An implementation of this parameterized transformation is expected to first use the 
elevation coverage to obtain the third ground coordinate, and then use a separate 
implementation of a ground-to-image transformation.

Annex I 
(informative) 


 
Schema flexibility 


I.1 Introduction 


This annex summarizes the flexibility supported by the CRS set of XML Schemas 
specified in Annex C. Much of this flexibility applies to the Application Schemas that 
can and should be developed using these CRS Schemas. However, considerable 
flexibility is supported without using an Application Schema, just using a selected XML 
element as the basis for an XML document. 


NOTE 1 Specification flexibility will reduce interoperability whenever different implementations 
support different subsets of the allowed flexibility. To maximise interoperability, each Implementation 
Specification using this specification should specify the subset required to be implemented (especially by a 
server), for each flexibility area allowed by this specification. Some of this subset specification can be done 
in the Application Schema(s) specified by that Implementation Specification. 


NOTE 2 Many of the concrete XML elements defined in these CRS Schemas can be used without 
Application Schemas, when no contents extensions or restrictions are needed. However, the Conversion, 
Transformation, ParameterValue, and ParameterValueGroup elements should not be used for well-known 
coordinate operation methods having many instances. Instead, an Application Schema that defines 
operation-method-specialized element names and contents should be prepared and standardized, see 
Subclause 6.3. 


I.2 Application Schema flexibility  


The CRS Schemas specified in Annex C support considerable flexibility in an 
Application Schema. That flexibility includes: 


a) Defining elements that can be attached as metadata to each (of about 30) concrete 
elements with identity (or GML objects). 


b) Extending most complexTypes by adding elements selected and/or defined to record 
additional data about the elements using that complexType. 


c) Restricting most complexTypes to reduce the allowed multiplicity of an included 
element, or restrict an included element to a selected element defined in the 
substitutionGroup of the currently included element. 


d) Extending some abstract complexTypes by adding elements deliberately not included 
in the abstract type, to facilitate definition of differently named and/or structured 
elements in Application Schemas. Those complexTypes include: 


1) AbstractGeneralConversionType 


2) AbstractGeneralTransformationType 


3) AbstractGeneralParameterValueType 







OGC 03-010r7 


© OGC 2003 – All rights reserved 221
 


NOTE 1 Such use of Application Schemas is discussed in Subclause 6.3, and example Application 
Schemas extending two of these three complexTypes is provided in Subclauses F.3 and F.4. 


e) Using or extending some abstract complexTypes and elements to define additional 
concrete subtypes. Those elements and complexTypes include: 


1) _CoordinateReferenceSystem, with AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystemType 


2) _GeneralDerivedCRS, with AbstractGeneralDerivedCRSType 


3) _CRS, with AbstractCRSType 


4) _Datum, with AbstractDatumType 


5) _CoordinateSystem, with AbstractCooordinateSystemType 


NOTE 2 These abstract complexTypes shall not be used or extended (in an Application Schema) to 
define a concrete subtype with a meaning equivalent to a concrete subtype specified in this document. If 
needed, these abstract complexTypes can be extended in an Application Schema to add more contents. Also 
if needed, these abstract complexTypes may be used or extended (in an Application Schema) to define an 
additional concrete subtype with a different meaning. 


EDITORS NOTE  These CRS schemas currently allow such uses and extensions because XML Schemas 
cannot preclude such uses. If appropriate, constraints could be added to the <documentation> elements for 
these complexTypes to prohibit undesirable additional concrete subtypes. 


I.3 Other flexibility 


In addition to flexibility provided by preparing an Application Schema, the CRS Schemas 
specified in Annex C support considerable flexibility without using an Application 
Schema. That flexibility includes: 


a) Units of measure (uom) used for each: 


1) "value" element in ParameterValueType, even for a single parameter 


2) "uom" attribute in CoordinateSystemAxisType 


3) "result" element in AbsoluteExternalPositionalAccuracyType and 
RelativeInternalPositionalAccuracyType 


b) Subtypes of AbstractPositionalAccuracyType used in 
AbstractCoordinateOperationType and all four of its' concrete subtypes. 


c) A Dictionary element can contain any combination of the concrete XML elements 
listed in Subclause 6.2, since all are substitutable for a Definition element in a 
Dictionary. A Dictionary element can also contain one or more UnitDefinition 
elements, as defined in units.xsd of GML 3. Furthermore, any of these concrete 
elements or a Dictionary can be included inside a GenericMetaData element inside a 
metaDataProperty element, which can be inside of many other XML elements.

d) Defining new and different sets of standardized values to be used as the contents of 
many elements with the gml:CodeType and xsd:string data types. Those elements 
include: 


1) derivedCRSType, in DerivedCRSType 


2) pixelInCell, in ImageDatumType 


3) verticalDatumType, in VerticalDatumType 


4) axisDirection, in CoordinateSystemAxisType 


5) axisAbbrev, in CoordinateSystemAxisType 


6) "scope", in AbstractReferenceSystemType, AbstractDatumType, 
AbstractCoordinateOperationType, and all of their subtypes 


7) anchorPoint, in each of four subtypes of AbstractDatumType 


8) measureDescription, in each of three subtypes of 
AbstractPositionalAccuracyType
