i.     Abstract




The OGC Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) standard defines a common conceptual information model for identification of specific hydrologic features independent of their geometric representation and scale. The model describes types of surface hydrologic features by defining fundamental relationships among various components of the hydrosphere. This includes relationships such as hierarchies of catchments, segmentation of rivers and lakes, and the hydrologically determined topological connectivity of features such as catchments and waterbodies. The standard also defines normative requirements for HY_Features implementation schemas and mappings to meet in order to be conformant with the conceptual model.




The HY_Features model is based on an abstract catchment feature type that can have multiple alternate hydrology-specific realizations and geometric representations. It supports referencing information about a hydrologic feature across disparate information systems or products to help improve data integration within and among organizations. The model can be applied to cataloging of observations, model results, or other study information involving hydrologic features. The ability to represent the same catchment, river, or other hydrologic feature in several ways is critical for aggregation of cross-referenced or related features into integrated data sets and data products on global, regional, or basin scales.

iii.   Preface




This standard defines the HY_Features common hydrologic feature model for use in identification of features as specific kinds of hydrologic features. It is intended to be used to document and share information about features that are the subject of hydrologic studies and reporting for a range of applications. HY_Features was originally commissioned to link hydrologic information across the scientific and technical programs of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and to assist WMO Members in discovering, accessing, and utilizing hydrologic data from different sources.




This standard is also intended to support the need for governance and guidance by national and international authorities. Aspects of the standard that support this goal are 1) canonical form, 2) implementation neutrality, 3) conformity to internationally recognized geographic information standards, and use of semantics inferred from terminology endorsed by the WMO and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

vi.  Relationship to the OGC® Abstract Specification




The HY_Features conceptual model, described in this standard, references
concepts defined in the OGC Abstract Specification (OGC AS). Conformance
to the OGC AS may be achieved via specialization of the relevant concept.
An example of this kind of conformance is a geographic feature specialization
that carries specific hydrologic feature attributes and associations. Conformance
may also be achieved by asserting a correspondence or analogy between HY_Features
concepts and OGC AS concepts. For example, the river reference system for
referencing positions along a nominal flowpath corresponds to linear referencing
along any linear feature element.
This standard requires no changes to the current version of the OpenGIS Abstract
Specification.








1. Scope



This OGC Implementation Standard defines a common conceptual feature
model for use in identification of features as typical features of the
hydrology domain using established models and patterns in use in the
Hydrology domain and endorsed by WMO and UNESCO such as those documented
in the "International Glossary of Hydrology".





This standard, along with expected future implementations of this
conceptual model, will form the third part of an intended 'OGC WaterML
2' suite of standards that groups water-related OGC standards. Following
Part 1: Timeseries, Part 2: Ratings, Gaugings and Sections, this
standard is titled Part 3: Surface Hydrology Features Conceptual
Model.





This document introduces the HY_Features conceptual model only. The
normative model is a machine-readable UML artifact published by the OGC
in conjunction with this document at: http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/uml/. Clause 7 of
this document presents requirements classes (ways of conforming to the
conceptual model) and requirements for model implementations to meet in
order to be considered conformant with the conceptual model. Conformance
classes indicating how to demonstrate conformance to requirements are
presented in Annex A.





Future standards documents in this series are expected to specify
particular implementations of the conceptual model. For example, an
OWL/RDF implementation will define machine-processable entities and
relationships in the OWL schema language that implement the HY_Features
conceptual model elements. HY_Features implementations are expected to
support documentation and discovery of data as well as aid data
transformation efforts. For example, a discovery service such as a
catchment catalog might use HY_Features concepts to index services that
provide differing catchment representations as well as related water
quality and quantity observations. A catalog client could then use the
index for automated analysis and data product generation.





The initial scope has been defined by the WMO Commission for Hydrology
(WMO-CHy): to facilitate data sharing within the hydrologic community of
the WMO Member countries and to improve the quality of data products
based on these data by defining hydrologic features to convey their
identification through the data processing chain "from measurement to
hydrological information" [8].





To enable semantic interoperability of hydrologic data and services, it
is necessary to agree on common concepts and methods. The HY_Features
model was developed in order to formalize concepts and relationships of
hydrologic and hydrographic features using the WMO/UNESCO "International
Glossary of Hydrology" as a starting point. One of HY_Features main
objectives is to provide a standard terminology for description of
relationships between hydrologic features that can be used to implement
data transfer formats. However, this conceptual model should be seen as
a building block toward a hydrographic data interchange standard,
but such a standard would require additional efforts.





HY_Features is meant to support linking data products across differing
applications and jurisdictions. To enable this, the concept of a
holistic catchment is defined and "hydrology-specific realizations" of
the catchment concept are modeled as typical hydrologic features. This
allows a particular catchment to be represented in different feature
data products for different purposes while still retaining its identity.





The HY_Features model provides a basis for common and stable references
that identify hydrologic features in a wide variety of applications:





	
to link hydrologic observations to their feature-of-interest, e.g.
link a streamflow observation to the river or catchment being observed,


	
to allow aggregation of cross-referenced features into integrated
data sets and data products on global, regional, or basin scales,


	
to enable systems to unambiguously link data between systems and
domains,


	
to enable cross-domain or multi-discipline services to communicate
through reference to standard concepts.







While HY_Features is intended to support a wide variety of applications,
it is narrowly focused on surface water hydrographic features. As such,
nuances of waterbodies and storages such as glaciers, snowfields, and
wetlands are left to future work. Additionally, temporal aspects of
hydrologic features are not addressed in this standard and would be
expected to be handled by implementations using HY_Features classes for
feature identification. Finally, as this standard precedes expected
encoding standards, implementation details, such as the structure and
handling of feature identifiers are out of scope.





This standard defines a conceptual model (normative) containing feature
type definitions that conform to the OGC General Feature Model (GFM)
(ISO 19101:2002 and ISO 19109:2006), expressed in the Geographic
Information Conceptual Schema Language (ISO 19103:2005) using the
Unified Modeling Language (UML). The GFM is a meta-model developed as a
general framework for features and their properties in the context of
geographic information. Feature types specific to an application domain
are defined as instances of the general feature metaclass with their own
sets of typical characteristics (property types and constraints) such as
attributes, associations, or operations.





As shown in Figure 1, the HY_Features conceptual model
defines instances of the general feature metaclass specific to the hydrology
domain. A general HY_HydroFeature type is defined to carry properties such as
identifier and name that all hydrologic features should have. Specific
feature types are then derived from HY_HydroFeature to reflect different
aspects of hydrology and carry properties specific to each aspect.
Figure 1 also illustrates that HY_Features features can
fill the role of features-of-interest or sampling features for hydrologic
observation data conforming to the Observation and Measurement (O&M) model
(ISO 19156:2011) or to hydro-specific O&M profiles such as in the OGC
WaterML 2' suite of water-related standards.

2. Conformance



This standard defines a conceptual model for hydrologic features and
their fundamental relationships. Requirements for conformance with the
conceptual model are defined for two types of implementation targets: a)
implementation schemas for representation of hydrologic data or b)
implementation mappings between terms or concepts from two or more other
existing hydro data schemas based on common intermediary HY_Features
concepts. Any conformant implementations are required to satisfy the
requirements defined in Clause 7 of this document for the requirements
class(es) with which they assert conformance. This is true whether the
implementation is explicit in the case of a schema (such as an OWL/RDF
ontology or XML schema) or implicit in the case of common concepts for a
schema mapping (such as an XSLT rule). The accuracy or detail with which
an external term is mapped to a HY_Features common concept is beyond the
scope of this standard, as is specification of a particular concept
mapping methodology.





Annexes C-G of this document provide, nevertheless, informative mappings
to and from HY_Features for the following hydro data models:





	
Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (AHGF) [11],


	
USGS National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHD Plus) [10],


	
INSPIRE Hydrography theme [2],


	
French National Service for Water Data and Reference-dataset
Management (SANDRE) [12],


	
Canadian National Hydrography Network (NHN) [13]







These mappings are intended to provide a general understanding of the
correspondence between HY_Features concepts and existing conceptual /
physical models. They are informative with respect to any future mapping
implementations.





Conformance of implementation targets with this standard shall be
verified using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative)
of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing,
and the criteria to be met to claim conformance are specified in the OGC
Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the
OGC Compliance Testing web site.




All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this
document are owned by the HY_Features standard.

4. Terms and Definitions



This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC
06-121r8], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for
the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular,
the word SHALL (not "must") is the verb form used to indicate a
requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.




For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and
definitions apply.




4.1. application schema


Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications [ISO 19101]






4.2. boundary (line)


Geometric representation of a (catchment) boundary, usually a geometric
composite curve.




	
Note

	
This definition references the definition of a divide described
as summit or boundary line [9].








4.3. catchment


A physiographic unit where hydrologic processes take place. This class
denotes a physiographic unit, which is defined by a hydrologically
determined outlet to which all waters flow. While a catchment exists, it
may or may not be clearly identified for repeated study.




	
Note

	

This approach considers the catchment concept to be the basic unit
of study in hydrology, water resources management, and environmental
reporting. The approach is meant to be holistic, referring to the
continuous interaction of surface and subsurface waters within a
catchment, even if a particular representation of the catchment refers
to only surface or subsurface aspects of the catchment. Special subtypes
such as drainage basin and groundwater basin may be defined with a
particular application.





The synonymous use of the terms catchment and catchment area in the
WMO/UNESCO International Glossary of Hydrology (which is the key
reference for the definitions in the HY_Features model) does not clearly
distinguish between the catchment concept and its geometric
representations such as catchment area, nor between catchment and its
possible specializations like drainage basin and groundwater basin.





To satisfy the need for a both a holistic definition of catchment and
various refinements of it, the catchment feature type is refined by
defining feature types that reflect distinct perspectives on the
holistic catchment concept. In this standard, this type of refinement is
referred to as hydrology-specific catchment realization. Also see clause
5.4 of this standard on the use of WMO terminology.











4.4. catchment area


Two-dimensional (areal) hydrology-specific realization of the holistic
catchment. Topologically, the catchment area can be understood as a face
bounded by catchment divide and flowpath edges. The concept of a face
bounded by edges is described in detail in the ISO topology model
[ISO19107]. The catchment area is usually represented as a geometric
surface, and the measure of the catchment area may be denoted as surface
area.






4.5. catchment divide


One-dimensional (linear) feature that is a hydrology-specific
realization of the holistic catchment. Topologically, catchment divide
can be understood as an edge bounded by inflow and outflow nodes. The
concept of an edge bounded by nodes is described in detail in the ISO
topology model [ISO19107]. The catchment divide is usually represented
as a geometric curve, or as a polygon ring feature.






4.6. catchment network (topology)


Edge-node topology pattern of a set of catchments connected by their
hydro nexuses. The topology pattern is derived from flowpaths, but
ultimately reflects the inferred hydrologic connectivity between
catchments and their hydro nexuses whether or not corroborated by
geometric representations.






4.7. (internal) catchment topology


Topology pattern between hydrology-specific realization of a particular
catchment. Example: Catchment area associating its catchment divide and
the draining flowpath. This could include subsurface and atmospheric
volumes, surficial catchment area, network of drainage channels and/or
waterbodies, a linear flowpath, and an outlet (and possible inlet) node.






4.8. channel


Natural or artificial waterway, clearly distinguished, which
periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a
connecting link between two bodies of water [9].






4.9. channel network


Connected set of depressions and channels that continuously or
periodically contain water.






4.10. cross section (of a stream)


Section of a stream at right angles to the main (average) direction of
flow [9].






4.11. cross section (of a stream bed)


transversal section of a stream bed in a vertical plane. This definition
references the definition of a bed profile describing the shape of a
stream bed in a vertical plane [9].






4.12. data


Documented value of some characteristics of a real-world phenomenon.






4.13. data set (also dataset)


Data compiled and arranged into a set. Used in its concatenated form to
indicate a specific dataset, or as data set, for non-specific sets of data.






4.14. data product


Data set compiled for a specific purpose, e.g. for global dissemination using
Web services.






4.15. dendritic catchment


Catchment in which all waters flow to a single common outlet. A
dendritic catchment is permanently connected to others in a dendritic
(tree) network, the most common drainage pattern of streams ultimately
flowing into the ocean after joining together at confluences into larger
and larger streams.






4.16. depression


Landform lower than the surrounding land and partially or completely
closed that is able to, but does not necessarily, contain water.






4.17. domain feature


Feature of a type defined within a particular application domain. [ISO
19156].






4.18. endorheic (drainage)


Draining [ultimately] into interior catchments [9].






4.19. exorheic (drainage)


Draining [ultimately] into the ocean.






4.20. feature


Abstraction of real-world phenomena [ISO 19101].






4.21. flowpath (also flow path)


One-dimensional (linear) feature that is a hydrology-specific
realization of the holistic catchment. Topologically, flowpath can be
understood to be an edge bounded by inflow and outflow nodes, and
associated with left-bank and right-bank sub-catchment faces. The
concept of an edge bounded by nodes is described in detail in the ISO
topology model [ISO19107]. The flowpath is usually represented as a
geometric curve.




	
Note

	

A flowpath feature may form the "main stem" of the stream
network flowing to the catchment outflow node from its inlet node(s).




With respect to the river referencing system described in this
standard, the flowpath corresponds to the linear element 'that serves as
the axis along which linear referencing is performed' as described in
the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 19, Linear referencing [aka ISO
19148].









NOTE 3: Hydrologically, the flowpath references the path line __
described by a moving particle of water [9].






4.22. flow line (also flowline)


Geometric property of a flowpath, usually a geometric curve.




	
Note

	
This definition references the definition of a path-line [9]
through using the synonym flow line to express the geometric
property of a flowpath.








4.23. hydrographic network


Aggregate of rivers and other permanent or temporary watercourses, and
also lakes and reservoirs [WMO, 2016].




	
Note

	
Not to be confused with the network of hydrological stations and observing
posts.








4.24. hydrologic complex


Collection of distinct hydrologic features forming a hydrologically
connected system where the union of one or more catchments and a common
hydro nexus is realized by multiple complexes of hydrology-specific
topological elements. For example, a single catchment may be
hydrologically realized as a face-edge complex of subcatchment areas and
divides, or an edge-node network of flowpaths and hydro nexus nodes, and
also as a dendritic edge-node network of either waterbodies or
containing channels.






4.25. hydrologic feature


Feature of a type defined in the hydrology domain, whose identity can be
maintained and tracked through a processing chain from measurement to
distribution of hydrologic information.






4.26. hydro(-logic) location


Any location of hydrologic significance located "on" a hydrologic
network that is a hydrology-specific realization of a hydrologic nexus.
In a given dataset, hydro locations may or may not have an associated
hydrologic nexus and associated catchment features. In such cases, hydro
locations would typically be linearly-referenced to a defined set of
catchments' flowpaths. Topologically, a hydro-location can be understood
as an inlet or outlet node located at the end of a flowpath edge. The
hydrologic location is usually represented as a geometric point.




	
Note

	
With respect to the river referencing system described in this
standard, a hydro-location feature can correspond to either the referent
that specifies a 'known, already referenced location on the linear
element' as described in the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 19, Linear
referencing [aka ISO 19148] or the reference location whose distance
from a referent can be measured along a linear element.








4.27. hydro(-logic) nexus


Conceptual outlet for water contained by a catchment. The hydro nexus
concept represents the place where a catchment interacts with another
catchment. Every catchment flows to a hydro nexus, conversely every
location in a hydrologic system can be thought of as a hydro nexus that
drains some catchment. Similar to catchments, hydro nexuses can be
realized in several hydrology-specific ways.




If a given hydro nexus does not have a known hydrology-specific
realization or is undetermined, it is termed 'nillable' in this
standard. For example, a hydro nexus exists in the form of flow to the
subsurface or atmosphere but may be undetermined and unrepresented
within implementations focused on surface water hydrology and would not
be included or referenced.






4.28. hydrologic realization


A hydrologic feature type that reflects a distinct hydrology-specific
perspective of the catchment or hydro nexus feature types. Shares
identity and catchment-nexus relationships with the catchment or nexus
it realizes but has hydrologically determined topological properties
that express unique ways of perceiving catchments and hydrologic
nexuses. Distinct from representation in that it is a refinement of the
holistic catchment, allowing for multiple geometric representations of
each hydrologic realization.






4.29. hydrology


Science that deals with the waters above and below the land surfaces of
the Earth, their occurrence, circulation and distribution, both in time
and space, their biological, chemical and physical properties, their
reaction with their environment, including their relation to living
beings. [9]






4.30. hydrometric feature


Feature of a type which denotes a physical structure intended to observe
properties of a hydrologic feature.




	
Note

	
This definition references the definition of a hydrometric
station at which data on water in rivers, lakes or reservoirs are
obtained on physical and chemical properties of water [9].
A hydrometric feature may be a composite station configured by arranging
several monitoring components. Used to sample a hydrologic feature, a
hydrometric feature may be considered a sampling feature as defined in
the ISO Observation model. A sampling feature is described in general in
ISO 19156: Observation and Measurement, the special monitoring point of
hydrologic observation is described in the OGC WaterML 2.0: Part 1-
Timeseries standard [4].








4.31. hydrometric network


Aggregate of hydrologically connected monitoring stations situated on
and used for hydrologic observation of a feature such as a catchment or
hydrographic network. This definition references the definition of a
synonymous hydrological network consisting of hydrological stations
and observing posts situated within a catchment in such a way as to
provide the means of studying its hydrological regime [9].






4.32. hydrometry


Science of the measurement and analysis of water including methods,
techniques and instrumentation used in hydrology [9].






4.33. indirect position


Position expressing the location of a feature relative to the known
location of another feature. Indirect position requires a logical axis,
bounded by the feature being placed and the feature being used as a
reference, along which the position can be determined. Common examples
in hydrology are mileposts along a river referencing the river source
and/or mouth, and the placement of monitoring stations referencing
already located stations.






4.34. interior catchment


Catchment in which all waters are collected and drainage is endorheic;
an interior catchment does not drain to other catchments. This
definition is rooted in the blind drainage pattern of water collecting
in sinks or lakes not connected to streams [9].






4.35. longitudinal section (of a stream)


Vertical section of a stream in longitudinal direction. This definition
is rooted in the definition of a longitudinal section along a
channel at its center line [9], but generalized for all
types of vertical section along a line.






4.36. longitudinal section (of a stream bed)


Longitudinal section of a stream bed in a vertical plane. This
definition references the definition of a bed profile describing the
shape of a stream bed in a vertical plane [9].






4.37. main stem (also mainstem)


Main course along which water flows in a catchment excluding
tributaries. For any identified catchment, the flowpath connecting
inflow and outflow locations would typically correspond to or follow the
main stem, but the main stem is conceptually broader than the catchment
flowpath concept of HY_Features.






4.38. mapping


Establishing a semantic relationship between concepts in different
information models using a formalism that specifies how elements from a
source information model may be transformed into elements of a target
model. Every pair of N models generally require a separate (2-way)
mapping for each source concept (a total of N!/[2(N-2)!] mappings).
Mappings that in contrast involve transformation by way of a common
concept can be more efficiently expanded to more than two models as each
additional model only requires mapping once into the set of common
concepts (N mappings).






4.39. named feature


Feature identified by a name. Hydrologic features may have multiple
names depending on the cultural, political or historical context.






4.40. nillable


Nillable is meant in this standard to signify that a feature property
logically exists but may not be determined in a given implementation.






4.41. referent


Feature with a known location being used as a reference to locate
another feature on the logical axis that stretches between the two. The
(indirect) position of a new location is expressed as the distance along
that linear element from the known referent to the feature being placed.






4.42. representation


Any process-able data, data set, or data product which characterizes a
given feature concept.






4.43. river referencing


Referencing along a river applied to place a feature on a (linear)
waterbody feature. The feature location is specified as an indirect
position expressed as distance along the watercourse on which the
feature is to be placed.




	
Note

	
A (hydrologic) feature of interest which is located along the
locating one-dimensional flowpath between inflow and outflow nodes,
corresponds to the linear referencing described in the OGC Abstract
Specification Topic 19, Linear referencing 'specifying a location
relative to a linear element along that element' [ISO 19148].








4.44. storage (of water)


Impounding of water in surface or underground reservoirs, for future
use. [9]




	
Note

	
NOTE: Storage refers to a body of water from the perspective of a usable
water resource. The management of a reservoir itself, as a human action
with the objective of efficient and sustainable use of the resource, is
not in the scope of the conceptual model.








4.45. stream


Water, generally flowing in a natural surface channel, or in an open or
closed conduit, a jet of water issuing from an orifice, or a body of
flowing groundwater [9].






4.46. waterbody (also water body)


Mass of water distinct from other masses of water [9].






4.47. watercourse


Natural or man-made channel through or along which water may flow
[9], including large interstices in the ground, such
as cave, cavern or a group of these in karst terrain.

5.3. UML notation


Most diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the
Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described
in Sub-clause 5.2 of the OGC Web Services Common Implementation
Specification (OGC 04-016r2). UML classes are named in UpperCamelCase
and property names in lowerCamelCase.






5.4. WMO Terminology


The HY_Features model uses—​as far as possible—​terminology recommended by
the WMO Commission for Hydrology for use in the WMO Member countries.
The key reference is the "International Glossary of Hydrology"
[9] a joint  publication of the WMO and the UNESCO
(hereinafter referred to as WMO/UNESCO glossary of hydrology). Wherever
appropriate, terms from this glossary are applied to the feature concepts
in this standard to capture meaning and contextual relationships. The synonym
approach widely used in this glossary is interpreted as signifying that
synonymous terms are not necessarily synonymous in every respect. Differences
in terminology were explored through reconciling the explicit definitions
documented in the glossary with usage reflected in various data sets and
products. The accepted terms were augmented with the relationships inferred
from other terminology in order to define complex terms that do not clearly
distinguish between a specific logical concept and its geometric
representation or between a general term and its specific conceptual
meaning. The definitions used in the conceptual model described in this
standard may be understood as a conceptual refining and/or narrowing of
the definitions given in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology.




Some words have been avoided because of their disparate uses in various
implementation schemes. The words "reach" and "mainstem" are examples
that are used to refer to such a variety of collections of features,
that they have been avoided. Similarly, the term "watershed" is used and
defined differently depending on its context and has been avoided.
Unfortunately, it is inevitable that the terminology in HY_Features will
conflict with one or more schemes or implementations of hydrologic
features. In these cases, great care will need to be taken and the
specific feature type names from HY_Features should be used when
necessary.




Though rooted in the definitions given in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of
Hydrology, many of the hydrologic features in this standard have been
defined more specifically for relevance to the surface water domain.
Some requirements defined in this standard refer to the Scoped Name
concept of ISO 19103: Conceptual Schema and any such Scoped Name
implementations should reflect if possible a name endorsed by the WMO.






5.5. Naming convention


The HY-prefix used in the UML model follows the ISO naming conventions
for UML elements. There is no explicit requirement to use this same name
in a corresponding implemented term but conformance will require that
each such term be clearly connected back to its corresponding conceptual
model term.










6. Clauses not Containing Normative Material



6.1. The abstract idea of the hydrology phenomenon


Processes that continuously deplete and replenish water resources cause
or result in a wide range of phenomena that are the subject of
monitoring, modeling and reporting in hydrology and related sciences.
This standard conceptualizes these distinctly named or otherwise
uniquely identified real-world hydrologic phenomena as hydrologic
features.








Figure 2. Processes of the Hydrologic Cycle




Water is moving from the atmosphere to the Earth and back to the
atmosphere due to the processes forming the Water Cycle
(Figure 2). Water from precipitation reaching the land
surface is accumulated in waterbodies occupying empty space on the land
surface or in water bearing formations of soil and rock. Excess water overflows
these formations and is driven downhill by gravity. Water flowing over soil or
rock causes erosion to occur. This erosion tends to concentrate flowing
water into waterbodies that flow downhill using a connecting system of
channels intersecting other waterbodies along their way to a common
outlet, conceptualized as a single (potentially complex or ambiguous)
hydrologic location which may be described as an outlet, confluence, or
nexus.




Looking back upstream from the outlet location, the corresponding
catchment feature draining to it can be thought to have several distinct
hydrology-specific forms: a flowpath feature, a catchment area feature,
a catchment divide feature, a network feature of waterbodies, a network
feature of channels (or waterbody containers), or a network feature of
hydrometric (or observation) stations. All these are examples of what
are referred to in HY_Features as realizations of the holistic
catchment concept.




The most general conceptualization of hydrology phenomena is the
catchment. A catchment is a recognized unit of study where hydrologic
processes form physiographic features that are described in various data
products. It serves as the commonly recognized unit of water resources
assessment and management that can cross administrative jurisdictions.
In multi-stakeholder collaboration and cross-domain research projects,
catchments may be recognized as shared monitoring and reporting units.
Most typically, river monitoring stations are assigned to a recognized
catchment. Catchment inflow and outflows connect information between
recognized catchments. Regardless of the way catchments are realized and
represented, their basic identification can serve as the critical link
between disciplines and jurisdictions. Examples of defined
organizational catchments include the "Hydrologic Unit Code" (HUC)
catchments defined by the U.S. Geological Survey for research and
regulatory data systems to use as a reference [7] and
"River Basin Districts" of the European Water Framework Directive
[1]. In contrast to these, monitoring and research
stations and hydrologic locations like bridges and confluences often
imply or hydrologically determine identified catchments.




In this specification, a catchment feature provides a means to have an
identified grouping of hydrologic study activities and data artifacts.
A catchment may be realized by catchment-realization features whose
connectivity may be described using one or more topological properties
and geographic characteristics represented by geometric properties.
The term realization is used here to imply that a holistic feature
type like catchment can have more specific hydrologic feature types that
share identity with but express a different aspect of it. The term
realization is not meant to be interpreted as a Unified Modeling
Language realization relationship.




The three terms, identification, realization, and representation,
are very important to understanding the HY_Features conceptual model.
Identification of a hydrologic feature implies that a feature has a
hydrologically significant identity and would normally have a name in
common usage. Realization implies a particular hydrologic feature type
which has specific hydrologically determined topological properties and
relationships. Representation implies that the particular realization
of a feature has been defined by a particular geometric shape. For
example, the Amazon River is identified in that we have a name for it
and a vague notion of the Amazon River catchment. We can realize the
Amazon River catchment, thinking of it in a number of ways: as a
boundary ridge line, a surface covering the drained area, a linear
flowpath from source to mouth, etc. Each of those hydrologic
realizations may have different representations: the boundary may have
surface and groundwater contributing variants, the area might have
elevation and land cover variants, the flowpath might have a one
dimensional simple and three-dimensional complex variant. Using
HY_Features, each of these representations could be identified as being
a particular representation of a particular hydrologic realization of
the Amazon River catchment.




Depending on application and (spatial) scale, the same catchment may be
realized in a number of different ways. The following are examples of
the multiple realization pattern:




	
The most typical example is that scaling a map-visualization up
or down requires realization of a catchment as a single flowpath or
boundary at one scale and a network of flowpaths or boundaries at
another scale.


	
Analyses and reports from different disciplines may reference
differing realizations of the same conceptual catchment. For example,
one discipline may realize a network of waterbodies while another
realizes a network of channels.


	
Some applications require cartographic (visual) realizations
while others are focused on topological (network connectivity)
realizations only.


	
A catchment may be realized geometrically by streamline, drainage
area/surface, bounding polygon, or stream network, and realized
topologically as a face, or an edge.







Figure 3 illustrates some possible alternative catchment
realizations.

6.2. Catchment and realizations of the catchment concept


The core concept of the HY_Features model is that studies of hydrology
phenomena have a need to reference common conceptual entities of the
hydrosphere—​such as catchment, waterbody, channel, or monitoring
position—​through the use of feature types defined in a specific model
(as per ISO 19109 General Feature Model). Depending on the field of
study or application, complex hydrology phenomena may be hydrologically
realized as different feature types. Recognizing the catchment as the
holistic unit of study allows multiple realizations and the information
they carry to be connected to the same identified conceptual entity.
Figure 4 is a graphic meant to represent the basic catchment
concept visually without highlighting any particular realizations.








Figure 4. This figure should be interpreted as the idealized catchment concept independent of realization or representation. Later figures use it as a base upon which realizations are highlighted.




Fundamental to the catchment concept is that each catchment is defined
by and paired hydrologically with a hydro nexus which forms the
outlet to which all catchment waters drain and potentially the inlet
that corresponds with the outlet(s) of upstream catchment(s). A hydro
nexus is always defined as the feature that provides connectivity
between catchments and can have a hydrology-specific realization that is
a hydrologic location. Hydrologic locations stand alone as features such
as confluences, stream gages, pour points, or bridges and can be the
real-world feature that we think of as the location of a nexus between
two or more catchments. It’s important to highlight that hydrologic
locations do not have to realize a hydro nexus. In many cases, they will
be network-linked features without associated catchments, while in other
cases, they are realizations of hydro nexus features.




Hydro nexuses, like catchments, are features that may have one or more
hydrology-specific realizations that are single locations, complex
locations, or even diffuse or indistinct geographies. In the absence of
such realizations, systems of catchments and hydro nexuses can form a
topological complex based on their hydrologic connectivity even if their
topological elements are not or cannot be represented geometrically.
Building on concepts of hydrologically determined catchment topology and
multiple catchment realizations, a collection of hydrologic features
that realize a larger catchment can be said to form a hydro complex
that is comprised of the collection of catchment and hydro nexus
features and any other feature(s) that realize the catchment and/or the
hydro nexus. A hydro complex may include multiple realized topologies
such as flowpath, catchment area, stream or channel networks.








Figure 5. Multiple catchment realizations (top left to bottom right): a) catchment boundary, b) catchment area, c) catchment flowpath d) subcatchment network, e) hydrographic network, f) geo-schematic network, g) flow network, h) hydrometric network of monitoring stations.




Catchment area, catchment divide, and linear flowpath are the most
common topological realizations of the catchment concept, and are widely
used to create cartographic representations of a catchment. Map layers
that provide visualizations of the hydrographic network of waterbodies
(typically as blue lines for small rivers and blue polygons for larger
rivers and lakes) or of channels (typically lines displaying a drainage
pattern indicating the path that flow may follow), or a network of
hydrometric monitoring stations, are usually combined to represent the
catchment as a whole. Figure 5 adds graphical representations
of such realizations to the idealized catchment of Figure 4.




6.2.1. Hydrologic Features Schemes


Each hydrology-specific realization of a catchment is a different way of
thinking of the catchment that emphasizes different hydrologic and/or
topological characteristics. While these distinctions are useful, many
nuances of a given dataset may not be evident from the feature types
alone. For example, a map of catchment polygons may portray a
non-overlapping coverage of sub-catchments, or a collection of
overlapping catchment polygons that correspond to monitoring stations.
It is very important to understand that every hydrologic feature dataset
follows a unique "scheme" with regard to the general concepts of
HY_Features. That is, catchments' type and role in a particular
application or data set, such as catchment hierarchy, upstream-downstream
relationships, and cross-scale realization correspondence, will vary
according to the needs of the application.




Some applications have no need for geometric representations of
catchments at all. In such schemes, topological networks of catchments
without geometries are used by themselves. An example of this might be a
data system supporting hydrologic modeling. Geospatial data may be used
to parameterize models that then run only using topological catchment
relationships. In this kind of scheme, the topological realization may
not correspond to a single geometric representation. For example, when
it is modeling a diffuse area of drainage between two model units, a
hydro nexus may take on the topological role of a node without
being represented geometrically as a single point.




A very common scheme that includes geometric representation is sometimes
referred to as the "reach-catchment" scheme and is typified by the U.S.
NHDPlus [10]. In this case, the catchment network forms
a continuous coverage of incremental drainage units where each catchment
corresponds to one and only one flowpath. This scheme comes about as a result
of elevation derived hydrography where, at a given scale, incremental
drainage polygons are defined for every confluence-to-confluence
flowpath. This scheme can be described using HY_Features, but many of
its specific constraints and nuances are implementation details that
would be specified in a profile and/or implementation of HY_Features.




Considering data sets that include multiple realizations and/or
representations of features across two or more scales, the idea of the
implementation scheme is very important. For example, consider a dataset
that has high-resolution and low-resolution variants of
reach-catchments, as described above. The flowpaths of the
low-resolution catchments may or may not be represented by the union of
the set of high-resolution catchments' flowpaths that connect its inflow
to outflow. A scheme may also include different kinds of realizations or
representations for higher or lower resolution features. For example, at
one scale, all waterbodies in a network may be represented as linear
flowpaths merely connecting catchment inlet to catchment outlet. At
finer scales, the same waterbodies may be represented as waterbody
polygons that show inundated area or even as some form of mesh or
surface representing the containing bathymetry and/or the waterbody
volume. All these examples are supported by HY_Features, but would need
to be specified as a profile or with implementation by a particular
application.




Another example of a dataset-scheme is the idea of a "contracted
catchment" and a "contracted node" which are used in the Australian
Hydrological Geospatial Fabric [11] to describe catchments,
and associated outlet locations. The word contracted is used as in a legal
contract, meaning that a "contracted node" is one for which a contract
that it will be realized and given a representation in future versions
of the dataset has been established. Many hydrologic data sets have
similar varying-levels of permanence and governance of features'
identity. As far as HY_Features is concerned, these are implementation
details that would be specified as a profile or implementation of the
model.




Specific feature types defined in the HY_Features model include
HY_HydroFeature (in section 7.3.1), HY_Catchment, HY_HydroNexus,
HY_CatchmentRealization, HY_HydroLocation, HY_CatchmentArea,
HY_CatchmentDivide, HY_Flowpath, HY_HydroNetwork and
HY_CartographicRealization (section 7.3.2).








6.3. Catchment topology and hierarchy


An unlimited number of overlapping catchments can potentially be defined
in a given region since every point in that region corresponds to some
catchment that drains to it. However, catchments are normally connected
in drainage networks and built around significant features of the
terrain such as confluences. Catchment networks, that might form a
continuous coverage of the landscape, provide continuity between
catchments, the ability to aggregate catchments, and to trace flow up-
or down-stream.




In a network of catchments, morphological detail may be specified in
many ways. Inflows and outflows are often complex where water flows out
of one catchment and into another. As shown in Figure 6,
catchments may connect through simple confluences (Figure 6a), waterbodies
or wetlands (Figure 6c), intermittent or subsurface flows (Figure 6d), complex
braided streams (Figure 6e), or distributary systems like deltas (Figure
6f). In some situations, diffuse (multiple) inflows can be conceptually
joined in a 'conjoint' catchment (Figure 6b) and spread (multiple)
outflows may be joined in a catchment flowing out at a single,
conceptual outflow (Figure 6e).








Figure 6. Catchment connectivity examples (top left to bottom right): a) Simple catchments with one inflow and one outflow each; b) conjoint catchments with an ambiguous divide flowing into a single downstream catchment; c) catchments joining in a waterbody or wetland with no clear network at their shared nexus; d) catchments joining through intermittent or subsurface flows; e) catchments that join through areas of complex or braided channels with an ambiguous divide near their junction; f) catchments with distributary hydro nexuses such as in a delta.




Although these cases require different geographic representations, they
can be represented using the same pattern of the catchment and hydro
nexus. Since all these cases can be specified referencing a simple
internal edge-node catchment topology, no special treatment is required
to handle the variation of flow processes. While Figure 6
illustrates a simple dendritic junction, and a method to handle complexity
through encapsulation, it’s important to note that HY_Features can support
non-dendritic network topology where a given hydro nexus may be
distributary and contribute flow (be an inflow hydro nexus) to multiple
catchments.




Any catchment may also be nested in a larger containing catchment or
split into multiple sub units to define catchment hierarchies. Two types
of catchment hierarchical relations are supported in HY_Features: basic
nesting and dendritic aggregation. Basic nesting allows any catchment to
reference a containing catchment (Figure 7) without defining any
particular interconnections between the two. Dendritic aggregations
(Figure 8) consist of specialized dendritic catchments that
contribute exorheic flow to an outlet and support simple topological
relationships that allow determination of flow from upstream to downstream
catchments. Specialized interior catchments add support for endorheic flow or
interior drainage within dendritic aggregations.

Figure 8. Catchment hierarchy with smaller catchments (C1, C2, C3) part of a dendritic catchment network, which is itself a catchment and corresponding HY_Features UML classes.






6.4. Catchment network realization


As discussed above, catchments may have a number of hydrology-specific
realizations. A network of catchments that interact at hydro nexuses can
be realized as a network of catchment realizations. For example, a
network of catchments, each realized as a flowpath, can be realized as
the network of linear flowpath edges connected by hydro location nodes.
Figure 9, Figure 10, and
Figure 11 illustrate how a single catchment C1
is realized as a catchment area (light grey catchment area A) and also
as a flowpath (red line F). Each catchment is potentially connected to
other catchments at its outflow nexus n1 (Figure 10) and/or inflow nexus
n2 (Figure 11). The flowpath geometry may trace the main flowpath
through the catchment or it could be a purely schematic straight-line
representation of a topological edge. Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure
11, include UML diagrams that describe the hydrologic features
highlighted in the figures.








Figure 9. Catchment area (grey area A) and flowpath realization (red line F) that connects catchment inflow to outflow for a defined hydrologically significant unit (C1) and corresponding HY_Features UML classes.








Figure 10. Catchment (C1), realized by a flowpath (red line F) and area (grey area A), contributes to a common outflow hydro nexus node (n1) and corresponding HY_Features UML classes.








Figure 11. Catchment (C1), realized by a flowpath (red line F) and area (grey area A), receives inflow from hydro nexus node n2 and corresponding HY_Features UML classes.




In a network of dendritic catchments, one or more catchments may
contribute outflow to a given hydro nexus, but only one catchment can
receive inflow from that nexus. This hydrology-specific topological
relationship is maintained regardless of the geometric representation of
the hydro location which realizes the nexus. The association role names
inflow and outflow are used to unambiguously describe the flow
direction at a hydro nexus with respect to a dendritic catchment.




Catchment networks that appear non-dendritic, such as broad river
bottoms with complex braided channels and two or more primary inflows,
can be modeled with HY_Features. While a catchment contributes flow to a
single outflow hydro nexus, there is no restriction on the number of
catchments contributing to a hydro nexus. Figure 12a illustrates a case
where hydro nexus nodes n2 and n3, both have two contributing catchments
and have one and two receiving catchments respectively. Such situations are
quite common in hydrologic systems. Examples include prairie pothole or ponded
wetland landscapes, networked urban drainage systems, waterbodies with multiple
outflows, and non-surface-contributing regions with ambiguous or complex
outflows. While HY_Features does not attempt to model all these types of
features, it does support non-dendritic catchments, if an application supports
them, and it provides mechanisms to encapsulate such real-world
complexity.




By introducing conjoint catchments that encapsulate non-dendritic parts,
such complex situations can also be modeled as dendritic networks of
catchments. Figure 12 shows a non-dendritic stream network,
where it is not possible to determine to what extent flow from catchment F
contributes to catchments E or C (Figure 12a) without additional
information. Joining the catchments E, B, and C (Figure 12b) and
collapsing their inflow (/outflow) nexuses n2 and n3 into a single virtual
inflow hydro nexus, accumulates all the flow from catchments D and F in the
resulting catchment X. Some implementations could go even further,
eliminating node n2 and lumping catchment D into X as well. While not
required, this encapsulation approach can be used to model a complex
catchment topology as a simple dendritic network.








Figure 12. Non-dendritic stream network complexity: a) non-dendritic detailed flow b) unambiguous aggregated flow.




The topological pattern of a catchment network is shared with all of its
hydrology-specific realizations, although the topological "level"
(solid, face, edge, node) of a realization may vary. A given scheme
topologically realizes catchments as a solid bounded by inflow/outflow
faces, a face bounded by inflow/outflow edges, or an edge bounded by
inflow/outflow nodes. A single catchment may also be realized as a
topological complex consisting of all of the flowpath edges, and hydro
location nodes forming the surface drainage of that catchment. The
topological role that each hydrology-specific realization feature plays
may or may not correspond directly to its geometric representation. For
example, a waterbody plays the role of a flowpath edge between its inlet
and outlet, but may be represented geometrically as a polygon ring.






6.5. Surface water networks


Maps displaying a representation of a catchment are very common in
hydrology research and engineering. Depending on the scientific concern
and application, as well as the spatial scale of interest, different
aspects and details of hydrology phenomena may be represented using
application-specific map symbols. HY_Features accommodates this
diversity with multiple alternate hydrology-specific realizations of the
catchment and hydro nexus concepts which in turn may be represented
alternately as geometric points, lines, polygons, or surfaces, or as
aggregates of these geometric types. This standard is based on a
hydrologically determined topology model of directed hydro nexuses
acting as inflow or outflow locations for catchments which in turn
connect them. This topological catchment network pattern can be realized
in context-specific networks of features which each realizes a single
catchment or hydro nexus, especially in hydrographic networks of
waterbodies or networks of surface depressions and channels that may
contain waterbodies. These network features may in turn have a variety
of scale- and application-specific geometric representations. For
example, a fixed landmark point on a waterbody, or a cross-section line
separating a watercourse can each represent a hydro location node that
realizes a nexus within the hydrology-specific topological hydro
complex.




6.5.1. Hydrographic and channel network


Surface water flows in networks, and so hydrographic data is commonly
organized into those same networks. Surface water networks are also
self-similar; the patterns of rivers and deltas visible at a continental
scale resolve continuously into similar but more detailed nested
networks of streams, lakes, confluences, and other features as the
spatial scale of mapping and inquiry increases. The HY_Features model of
catchment networks and nested waterbody and channel network realizations
is intended to address the multi-scale nature of hydrologic data and
connect hydrologic phenomena and observations across a range of these
scales.




The basic elements of surface water networks at any scale are
waterbodies and the channels and depressions through which they flow
and in which they are contained. Following the definitions in the
WMO/UNESCO "International Glossary of Hydrology" [9] a
waterbody is understood as the mass of liquid water accumulated on or below
the land surface as a body of flowing water, which in some parts may have
stagnant water that is not moving or flowing. The waterbody concept
formalized in this specification is consistent with this definition, but
focuses on surface-waterbodies only. A conceptual model capturing the
specifics of bodies of groundwater as well as aquifers containing
groundwater are provided by the WaterML2: Part 4 - GroundwaterML2
specification [6]. A future WaterML2 specification part
is expected to complete the sub-atmospheric hydrologic cycle by addressing
features such as recharge zones and springs that connect groundwater with
surface water phenomena.




The container for a waterbody, a channel or depression, is commonly
understood as a type of natural or man-made watercourse through or along
which water may or may not flow [9]. A network of channels
(or drainage pattern) exists independent of whether it contains water at a
particular time. The HY_Features conceptual model accommodates both targets
(waterbody and container) of hydrologic study by defining separately and
then linking together waterbody features and containing land surface
features. Note that flow-through or standing lakes and similar features
are considered to be types of waterbodies whose container is a
depression.




Connected waterbodies with their associated containing channel network
make up the hydrographic and channel networks that hydrology-specific
realize the catchment that the networks drain. Individual waterbodies
themselves can also be characterized in more detail along vertical
cross- or longitudinal sections as well as within horizontal strata as
to their distinct thermal, salinity, oxygen, and nutrient
characteristics, etc. Such bathymetric and strata information may also
be represented as or derived from a surface such as would be derived
from LiDAR. Waterbodies or their strata may also be recognized as
storage reservoir features with water use, regulation, or control
characteristics.




In order to form hydrographic or channel networks, waterbodies or
channels that hydrologically realize catchments as topological edges
need to be connected by way of topological nodes. The HY_Features model
therefore connects waterbodies or channels through a hydro location
which realizes the hydro nexus corresponding to these catchments.
Although an entire network realizes the catchment that it drains to a
single hydro nexus, each hydro location node connecting waterbodies or
channels can also be thought of as a realization of a hydro nexus that
drains the sub-catchment which feeds that waterbody. The catchment
relationships defined in the catchment model described in this standard
can be used for both the larger catchment realized by the whole
hydrographic network and the catchment(s) whose hydro nexuses can be
used to connect waterbodies at hydro locations within the hydrographic
network. While there is conceptually a hydro nexus realization at the
outlet of every flowing waterbody, it’s important to point out that not
all waterbodies will have identified or realized hydro nexus features in
every dataset. However, the conceptual existence of a hydro nexus and a
hydro location which realizes it at the outlet of a waterbody is
important to form cross-scale and cross-dataset hydro location ties
between channels, waterbodies, and the catchments they drain.




It is common practice to realize a catchment as a single main-stem
flowpath (Figure 5c) as well as a complete hydrographic or channel
network. There is some choice in which catchments to delineate and
realize in this way. As discussed in section 6.2.1, some
elevation-derived hydrographic datasets define one associated drainage
"reach-catchment" for each stream segment connecting two confluences.
Others identify main-stem rivers that flow from their headwaters to a
common outlet. In either case, the corresponding catchment typically
carries the identity (name or some ID) of the main river and its outlet
is considered the mouth of the river. The main stem flowpath serves as
both a component of the stream network realizing a catchment and as a
standalone realization linking the inflow and outflow of that catchment.
Networks of flowpaths and hydro locations can in turn realize larger
catchment networks. At small scales, complex networks of watercourses
can have one main-stem flowpath made up of many smaller scale reaches.
At large scales, a network made up of one reach may serve as the single
main flowpath.




Specific HY_Features classes supporting surface water networks include:
HY_ChannelNetwork, HY_Channel, HY_Depression (in section 7.4.1),
HY_HydrographicNetwork, HY_WaterBody, HY_WaterBodyStratum,
HY_CrossSection, HY_LongitudinalSection, HY_Water_LiquidPhase, and
HY_Water_SolidPhase (in section 7.4.2).






6.5.2. Hydrometric network


Water bodies are observed using monitoring stations which are typically
physical locations with a well-established cross section they monitor.
It is common practice to locate a monitoring station in relation to
local landmarks and permanent reference points along a stream or in
relation to the outlet of the monitored waterbody. The river reference
system, described in section 7.3.3, gives a mechanism to locate such
points along a flowpath in relation to located hydro nexuses. When
aggregated into a network, monitoring stations within a catchment can be
said to make up a logically connected hydrometric network which monitors
a catchment.




For the purpose of linking identified monitoring stations, (thought to
be the sampling feature in terms of the observations and measurements
standard) and a river or other hydrologic feature (thought to be the
domain or sampled feature in terms of observations and measurements) a
specific hydrometric feature participating in a hydrometric network is
defined. The monitoring feature role of hydrometric features is unique
in contrast to all other hydro location types in HY_Features, which
would be used as observed domain features in observations and
measurements.




Specific HY_Features classes supporting hydrometric networks include:
HY_HydrometricNetwork and HY_HydrometricFeature described in section 7.5
of this standard.








6.6. Referencing hydrologic locations along a river


It is common practice in hydrology to reference hydrologic locations
(typically observation stations, but also designated reaches, or flood
plain zones) to an existing dataset, expressing the locations as a
distance along a particular linear flowpath waterbody. Given that the
flowpath has an established hydro nexus realization, whether located as
a network feature or inferred through a dataset convention such as
digitization direction, any hydrologic location can be referenced to the
network through association with an existing outflow (or inflow)
location and distance along the flowpath. Such a network location is
often determined on the fly through topological and/or geometric means
when a search is executed or as part of some automated data processing
routine. This standard does not preclude such techniques, but does not
attempt to address the permanence or method of establishing such network
locations. Instead, HY_Features provides a linear referencing data model
to facilitate relating hydrologic locations across data sets and scales.




To allow expression of cross-dataset links, this standard specifies a
system for referencing "along a river" by defining the one-dimensional
flowpath which realizes a particular catchment as a linear element and a
hydro location which realizes the hydro nexus of that catchment as the
reference location. A hydrologic location can be thought of as a tie
point between different hydrologic datasets. That is, the hydro nexuses
in one dataset can be realized as hydro locations and referenced in
another dataset. Similarly, hydro locations may actually be monitoring
locations, without identified hydro nexuses - which they theoretically
may realize. Whether used to link hydro nexuses and associated
catchments or other types of information, an identified hydro location
provides a way to link specific network locations between data sources.




The HY_Features conceptual model defines an indirect position which has
three properties: 1) a hydro nexus realized by a hydrologically
significant "reference location"; 2) a "linear element" defined by the
flowpath which starts or ends at the reference location; and 3) a
"distance from referent" measure providing an absolute or relative
(percentage) value. The relationship between the identified hydro nexus
(hydro location) and catchment (flowpath) is either inlet and downstream
catchment or outlet and upstream catchment, and can be used to provide
upstream or downstream directionality of the distance.




With a specified inflow or outflow hydro nexus as reference location and
a specific realization of its flowpath, each catchment can support its
own river referencing. Realized as a hydro location, a located hydro
nexus is the potential reference location at the end of a flowpath that
could split the original reference flowpath at the newly located hydro
location. For example, if two bridges are thought of as the inflow and
outflow locations of a catchment, the downstream bridge hydro location,
which realizes an outflow hydro nexus, may form the reference location
for stream gages upstream from the bridge and the next upstream bridge.
Similarly, the upstream bridge hydro location, which realizes the inflow
hydro nexus, may be the reference location for stream gages downstream from
the bridge and the next downstream bridge.




Note that in these cases, the upstream or downstream orientation of the
measurement is always declared in relation to the catchment inflow or
outflow. Since this varies in application, the orientation is specified
with an inflow or outflow association between the flowpath linear
element (catchment realization) and the reference point hydro location
(hydro nexus).




Applying the indirect position model, a feature of interest can be
related to a hydro nexus and the associated catchment by linking it to
an existing hydro location, or as a new hydro location linked to
a flowpath linear element and hydro nexus referent. It’s worth mentioning
that a special case of hydro location that is coincident with a hydro
nexus referent (at distance '0') could be considered a realization of
the hydro nexus.




6.6.1. Indirect position


Provided that the network of catchments is realized as one-dimensional
flowpaths and inflow and outflow hydro nexus locations (i.e. the
upstream or downstream end of the flowpaths is known), a feature of
interest can be located in the network along the linear flowpath
catchment realization. A new location can be placed along a flowpath in
reference to an already established inflow or outflow hydro nexus that
bounds the flowpath. The new network location can be expressed as a
distance along the flowpath 'measured' from the known flowpath end.
Figure 13 shows the simplest case, where the inflow of
a catchment is some linear distance upstream of a located outflow
measured along a flowpath.








Figure 13. Inflow node referenced along a downstream flowpath




Network location of features realizing a catchment hydro nexus


In the case that the new network location is to be a hydro nexus in a
pre-existing network, the already existing catchment would have to be
split into catchments upstream and downstream of what was just a
location, such as a stream gage, and becomes a hydro nexus that is
associated with (realized by) a location (stream gage). Once inserted as
a new hydro nexus, the upstream catchment would be realized as a
flowpath between the location (stream gage) and the inflow of the
now split catchment. Similarly, the downstream catchment would be
realized by a flowpath between the new location and the outflow of the
split catchment.




In this case, the unknown network position of the new location is known
to be the inflow or outflow hydro nexus location. Figure 14
shows a newly introduced hydro nexus that now splits an existing flowpath.
Because the new network location would now be a realization of the
outflow hydro nexus of the upstream catchment and the inflow hydro nexus
of the downstream catchment, its location is known to be the upstream
or downstream end of the associated catchments' flowpaths.








Figure 14. Newly introduced hydro nexus referenced along an upstream and downstream flowpath






Network location of features not realizing a hydro nexus


In the case that the existing catchment network is to be preserved, the
feature being located will not become a hydro nexus with associated
catchments. If the catchment and flowpath realizing the catchment is not
split, the indirect position is expressed as part of the known distance
between the inflow hydro nexus and the outflow hydro nexus, measured
along the connecting flowpath. Figure 15 shows a new
feature located along a flowpath. The location is expressed as the distance
measured from the located outflow. Similarly, the new location could be located
as a distance from an upstream hydro nexus measured along the flowpath.








Figure 15. New location referenced along a downstream flowpath, expressed as part of the known distance from outflow node






Network location of features in reference to an already referenced


location While not common in hydrographic datasets, the known reference
location does not have to be a hydro nexus. If a hydro location has an already
known network location, the indirect position can be expressed as part
of the distance along the flowpath measured from such an already
referenced location (located referent). Figure 16 shows
a feature located along a flowpath in reference to a downstream referent
that is located along the same flowpath relative to its outflow.








Figure 16. New location referenced along a downstream flowpath, expressed distance from a located feature, and finally as part of the known distance from outflow node






Location of features in a flowpath network


A feature of interest can be located somewhere along a particular
network flowpath in a flowpath network realizing a network of catchments
in two ways: 1) as a new inflow or outflow hydro nexus node bounding a
(newly split) flowpath at one end and in reference to the other end, or
2) referenced upstream or downstream of a flowpath end or an already
referenced location on a given flowpath. Figure 17, illustrates how a
newly introduced network location can be located along an upstream
flowpath, as an outflow node 'n1' referencing a known inflow node 'r2'
graphically and with representative HY_Features UML. Figure 18 shows the
location along a downstream flowpath referencing a known outflow node
'r1'.

Figure 18. Position (yellow dot) of an inflow node relative to an outflow node, determined along a downstream flowpath, expressed as a measured distance from a downstream referent (red dot) and representative UML classes.




Figure 19 illustrates how the position of a feature can be determined as
part the known distance between inflow and outflow nodes that bound a
flowpath in upstream and downstream direction. The origin of the
flowpath is set at one of its ends, and directed to the other. This
approach is used in the case that the new location is not to be declared
to be an inflow or outflow (hydro nexus node) of a catchment.








Figure 19. Intermediate Position (yellow dot) between known inflow and outflow nodes, expressed as distance from a located upstream or downstream referent (red dots).




The UML diagrams shown in Figure 17-19 illustrate that the river
referencing system defined in this standard generally corresponds with
the OGC standard model for Linear Referencing which is considered as the
general framework to assign a position to a feature of interest along a
hydrologic feature. The UML specifies fundamental properties of linear
referencing along a flowpath to express the referenced location as a
distance from a located referent, which may be the known inflow or
outflow hydro nexus node or another referenced location.




Specific HY_Features classes supporting the referencing 'along a river'
include HY_IndirectPosition, HY_DistanceFromReferent and
HY_DistanceDescription described in section 7.3.3 of this standard




Table 1 provides a descriptive 'mapping' intended to provide
a basic understanding of how the HY_Features river positioning system may
specify the OGC standard Linear referencing model. The river positioning
system is described in detail in section 7.3.3 of this standard, the OGC

6.6.2. Network navigation


Realizing catchments as topological edges bounded by hydro nexus nodes,
a network of catchments may be traced upstream from the sea or a sink
traversing from outflow node along catchment edge to inflow node of
(multiple) upper catchments recursively. One can navigate all the way
'upstream' eventually arriving at the outflow node of the headwater
catchments, which do not have an inflow hydro nexus. Starting at a
spring, the catchment network can be traced in the 'downstream'
direction, first to the single outflow node to which the catchment
contributes then further downstream eventually arriving at an outflow
node of an estuary or delta with no downstream catchment. In a given
realization, a sequence of linear flowpaths, each realizing a catchment
connected in the catchment network, may be drawn as streams or
watercourses, which may or may not be geometrically connected in the
representation.




When geometrically connected, the edge-node topology described above
could be implemented based on a geometric network made up entirely of
geometrically connected flowpaths. In some cases, the geometric network
is all that is required to satisfy network navigation requirements. A
second approach is to use the geometric network to create a topological
edge-node network. In other cases, waterbodies and channel parts of a
particular network may not form a well-connected network or be
represented using different types of geometry, not suited to geometric
network traversal. In such cases, a non-geometric topological
(node-edge) realization, made up of catchments and hydro nexuses only
could be used.




The network navigation approach described here corresponds generally to
the standard network (navigation) model defined within ISO 19133:
Location-based services - Tracking and navigation which is considered as
a general framework to trace a network of catchments. Provided that a
catchment is topologically realized comparable with the ISO topology
model as directed edge (flowpath) and the hydro nexus as directed
(inflow/outflow) node, the catchment network (as well as its
hydrographic, geomorphologic or hydrometric realizations) can be
navigated using the concepts of the ISO network (navigation) model.




In terms of network navigation, the hydrographic, channel or station
network can be thought of as a set of junctions and links that connect
these junctions. The realization of an inflow/outflow node is comparable
with the 0-dimensional junction associating 'incoming and outgoing
links', and the flowpath is comparable with 1-dimensional link
associated with a 'start' and an 'end' set by the inflow or outflow node.




Table 2 provides a descriptive 'mapping' intended to provide
a basic understanding of how the HY_Features network navigation may specify
the Tracking and navigation model.

7.1. The HY_Features conceptual model


This standard defines the HY_Features conceptual model as a standard for
the identification and description of hydrologic features reflecting
both hydrologic significance and topological connectivity of hydrologic
features. HY_Features formalizes the fundamental relationships between
components of the hydrosphere describing the hydrosphere as a
hierarchical network of hydrologically connected catchments, the various
realizations a catchment may have and the organization of catchments,
waterbodies or channels in networks.




The single concept that governs HY_Features is the hydrologically
determined union of a catchment and its hydro nexus: any place on the
land surface can be considered the hydro nexus of a corresponding
catchment. Catchments and hydro nexuses together form the basis of
networks of connected, usually named, hydrologic features. Other core
concepts of HY_Features are: 1) an abstract idea of 'catchment' which
has many possible geometric and/or topological feature realizations, 2)
catchments realized as networks of waterbody features, and 3) linear
referencing of river positions using a nominal main flowpath.




The conceptual model elements are grouped into three modules. A model
implementation may include any or all feature concepts included in any
module, include or exclude feature properties, and allow changing
cardinality of one or more associations to 'nillable,' expressing that
these logically exist but are not realized in a particular
implementation. Table 3 lists the modules, the leaf packages included in
each, and the concepts reflected therein.

The conceptual model is expressed in the Geographic Information

Modeling Language (UML). The organization of the HY_Features hydrology
model classes into modules, packages, and dependencies is shown in
Figure 20.

The HY_Features model specified in this standard is a 'conceptual
model,' and not intended to be directly implementable for data exchange
or persistence. The conformance target of the HY_Features model is
therefore either an implementation schema that implements concepts
defined in the HY_Features model, or a schema mapping that maps between
disparate existing feature types by means of common HY_Features
concepts.




The feature types in the HY_Features conceptual model are defined below
according to the modules and leaf packages described above into which
their UML classes have been grouped.






7.3. Hydro Feature concepts


The HydroFeature application schema provides the core concepts of a named
hydrologic  feature in the Named Feature (shown in Yellow) of a hydrologic
complex. For each complex, the union of catchment and its common outlet is
realized by a collection of hydrologic features (shown in Blue) and
a river referencing system, which allows placement of an arbitrary
feature 'along a river' using linear referencing (shown in Green) along
a one-dimensional topological flowpath realization.








Figure 21. Hydro Feature Application Schema Diagram




If required, an implementation should use terms from the code lists in
Annex B of this standard, defined specifically to conform to a
terminology common in the hydrology domain. Note that alternative code
lists may be used but should be related to the terms in Annex B.4 using
an appropriate formalism.








Figure 22. Hydro Feature – external dependencies




The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific
instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General
Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked
through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of
hydrologic information.




As an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is
identified by a unique identifier and typical properties. Typically, a
hydrologic feature is additionally identified through names in common
usage and through hydrologically significant characteristics.




The HY_HydroFeature feature type is specialized into more specific
feature types, which specify additional properties and represent
particular hydrologic phenomena (Figure 23).








Figure 23. Hydrologic features describing separate aspects of hydrology phenomena




The definitions of HydroFeature feature types are rooted in the
definitions documented in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology. They are
applied regardless of their application context in respect to the
Earth’s surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the
HY_Features conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology,
the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A
conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the
groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2:
Part 4 - GroundwaterML2 standard [6].




Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between
hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a
consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various
spatial or temporal representations.




7.3.1. The Named Feature model


The Named Feature model (Figure 24) defines the
HY_HydroFeature type as a basic feature to reflect the properties
that all hydrologic features have, such as names in cross-jurisdictional
and multi-lingual contexts. The HY_HydroFeature type has one association:
name.

Relation

This links a HY_HydroFeature object to zero or more
HY_HydroFeatureName objects.




The HY_HydroFeatureName type provides a pattern to handle cultural,
political and historical variability of names. This supports the
assignment of a referenceable name for all or parts of a hydrologic
feature without necessarily having a formal model for the naming.

7.3.2. The Hydro Complex Model


The Hydro Complex model describes a collection of hydrologic features that
form a hydrologically closed system. This includes the catchment, its
inflow and outflow (conceptualized as hydro nexuses) as well as various
realizations of catchment and hydro nexuses by typical hydrologic
features. In this complex, the union of catchment and its common outlet
determines the topological closure of an abstract catchment and its
inflow and outflow hydro nexuses. The catchment topology pattern, which
could, be expressed as a flowpath bounded by inflow and outflow nodes,
is then applied to realize the connectivity in hydrographic networks,
channel networks, or hydrometric networks.




The Hydro Complex model also allows catchments to be recognized through
reference to a hydro nexus even if stream networks, catchment areas or
catchment boundary are not available. It is intended that hydrological
reporting applications may use this model without the full complexity
and detail of scientific catchment models.




Catchment


The Catchment model conceptualizes the hydrologic determination of a
catchment through inflow and outflow hydro nexus features with the role
of getting flow from a contributing catchment, or providing inflow to a
receiving catchment (Figure 25 and Figure 26).
Conceptually, each catchment has an outflow hydro nexus, and any hydro nexus
has a corresponding catchment, even if catchment and/or hydro nexus may
not be present in a particular application. A catchment interacts with
upper and lower catchments via associated hydro nexuses, and ultimately
contributes flow to the hydro nexus of a containing catchment. The
catchment should be understood as the logical link between two hydro
nexuses.








Figure 25. Catchment model (UML class diagram)




The HY_Catchment feature type captures the union of catchment and hydro
nexus, and the multiple realizations of the holistic catchment concept.
These realizations include both topological realizations, as well as
their geometric representation. HY_Catchment may be further specialized
with respect to catchment interaction.




The HY_Catchment feature type (Figure 26) specializes the
general HY_HydroFeature type. Through generalization, HY_Catchment inherits
the name property. It carries a code attribute and the associations:
outflow, inflow, containingCatchment, containedCatchment,
conjointCatchment, upperCatchment, lowerCatchment,
catchmentRealization.

catchments. A dendritic network of catchments provided, where each
catchment is determined by its single outflow, this association can be

headwater catchments, or spread outflow occurring for example in estuary
catchments.

Catchment Aggregate


The HY_CatchmentAggregate feature type (Figure 30)
specializes the HY_Catchment type as a set of non-overlapping dendritic
and interior catchments arranged in an encompassing catchment. This can
be used to describe multiple inflows into a catchment aggregate through
several hydrologically discrete sub-catchments each with a single inflow,
and contributing to a joined outflow of the catchment aggregate, including
the 'nillable' outflow of interior catchments. Nillable is meant here to
signify that the hydro nexus logically exists in the form of flow to the
subsurface or atmosphere but is unknown in a given implementation.




Being a special type of the HY_Catchment, the catchment aggregate may be
part of a containing catchment at the next higher level of hierarchy,
which consists of similar-scale neighboring catchments. The catchment
aggregate does not necessarily imply a series of nested containing
catchments. It primarily allows navigation to the 'highest' level system
(total drainage basin) as typically used for reporting purposes.








Figure 30. Catchment aggregate (UML class diagram)




HY_CatchmentAggregate inherits through generalization the outflow,
inflow, containingCatchment, containedCatchment,
conjointCatchment, upperCatchment, lowerCatchment, and
catchmentRealization properties, as well as exorheicDrainage and
endorheicDrainage associations.

Dendritic Catchment


The HY_DendriticCatchment feature type (Figure 31) specializes
the general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is determined by a
single common downstream catchment. It represents the catchment as the
topological link between an inflow and an outflow. This allows
catchments to be connected in a dendritic network by upstream-downstream
relationships without knowing the complex hydrology between inflow and
outflow. This concept requires a stable identifier purposefully assigned
to the catchment and that catchments are delineated as a simple tree
hierarchy.








Figure 31. Dendritic catchment (UML class diagram)




HY_DendriticCatchment inherits from generalization the code,
outflow, inflow, containingCatchment, containedCatchment,
conjointCatchment, upperCatchment, lowerCatchment, and
catchmentRealization properties, as well as an encompassingCatchment
association. The dendritic nature of this feature is enforced through
single-outflow, single-receiving-catchment and
single-lower-catchment constraints.

directly to the ocean or an internal sink. An implementation SHOULD
unambiguously specify whether the receiving catchment exists, or is
nillable.

or an internal sink.
An implementation SHOULD unambiguously specify whether the lower
catchment exists, or is nillable.
	Constraint






Interior Catchment


The HY_InteriorCatchment feature type (Figure 32) specializes
the general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is generally not
connected to other catchments. This class describes the interior
catchment as a catchment enveloped by other catchments to which it may
temporarily contribute. While the interior catchment concept precludes
flow to neighboring surface catchments, holistically it is a candidate
for establishing connections to groundwater or atmospheric systems.

HY_InteriorCatchment inherits from generalization the code, outflow,
inflow, containingCatchment, containedCatchment,
conjointCatchment, upperCatchment, lowerCatchment, and

association. A nillable-outflow constraint emphasizes the
non-existing outflow.

Hydro Nexus


The HY_HydroNexus feature type (Figure 33) conceptualizes a
hydrologically determined nexus of a corresponding catchment
(Figure 26).
The hydro nexus represents the place where a catchment interacts
with another catchment, i.e. where the outflow of a contributing
catchment becomes inflow into a receiving catchment. A catchment may
receive flow from several upstream catchments or contribute flow to
several downstream catchments through a single hydro nexus. Through
shared identity, each hydro nexus feature may be associated with
different realizations within a hydrologic complex given that each
realization has the same hydrologic function or characteristics. This
includes the topological realization as a node on the one-dimensional
flowpath (edge) in terms of a topological 'boundary'.




Placed topologically relative to a catchment which links inflow and
outflow, a hydro nexus has a position relative to another hydro nexus
that is 'fixed' in the network by the catchments it is associated with.
Additionally, the union of catchment and hydro nexus(es) can be used to
define a linear river reference system, where an inflow or outflow node
is the origin and the flowpath realizing the catchment is the linear
element along which a position can be determined.




Although conceptually, a given catchment will always have a corresponding
outflow hydro nexus, 0..1 cardinality is used for HY_HydroNexus in the role
of outflow to provide an opportunity to use the catchment hierarchy model in
implementations where the (always logically existing) nexus is not known.
If required, an implementation may specify it to be 1..1.

HY_HydroNexus carries the associations: contributingCatchment,
receivingCatchment, and nexusRealization.

Catchment Realization


The HY_CatchmentRealization feature type (Figure 34) is based
on the idea that there are multiple hydrology-specific perspectives of the
holistic catchment concept that are used to describe a catchment as a
unit of study shared across sub-domains and studies.




A given catchment realization exists within a hydrologic complex in
that, if a catchment realization exists, it exists in the same
hydrologic complex as the catchment it realizes. In this way, any
realization of a catchment has the same hydrologic determination of the
catchment it realizes. If a catchment is connected with other catchments
via inflow and/or outflow hydro nexuses, its realizations are also
connected. A realization of the logical catchment is always of higher
topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding hydro
nexus topological boundary. For example, a linear flowpath realizing a
catchment may be understood as an edge between inflow and outflow nodes;
the areal realization of a catchment as a face bounded by linear inflow
and outflow.








Figure 34. Catchment realization and its specialization (UML class diagram)




The catchment realization features defined in this standard refer to
objects on the land surface for the purpose of surface water hydrology.
In other contexts, other types of catchment realization may exist.
Catchment realizations that do not conform to those defined in this
standard, for instance realizations in 3- or 4-dimensional perspectives,
may be implemented using the general HY_CatchmentRealization type.
HY_CatchmentRealization carries a shape attribute and a realizedCatchment association.

catchment topology, topological relationships can be established and
common identifiers assigned.



	Association




The HY_Flowpath feature type realizes a catchment specifically as a
path connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment it realizes.
HY_Flowpath specializes HY_CatchmentRealization with respect to an
implied linear geometric representation including a straight or curved
line. Topologically, the flowpath connects the inflow and outflow of the
catchment, and is understood as an edge bounded by an inflow node and an
outflow node, and corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment
faces. Hydrologically, the flowpath is a line describing a moving
particle of water. Through generalization, HY_Flowpath inherits the
shape and the realizedCatchment properties. The optional shape of
the flowpath is usually a single curve.




The HY_CatchmentDivide feature type realizes a catchment specifically
as catchment boundary connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment
it realizes, whereby inflow and outflow may overlay. Implying a linear
geometric representation, a catchment boundary is topologically
understood as an edge bounded by inflow node and outflow nodes, and
corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment faces inside of the
boundary. Hydrologically, the boundary refers to the summit line
separating adjacent catchments. Through generalization,
HY_CatchmentDivide inherits the shape and the realizedCatchment
properties. The shape of the catchment divide may be implemented as a
composition of succeeding curves or a polygon ring.




The HY_CatchmentArea feature type realizes a catchment specifically as
a catchment area connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment it
realizes. HY_CatchmentArea specializes HY_CatchmentRealization with
respect to an implied areal geometric representation. Topologically, the
catchment area connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment is a
face bounded inwards by an inflow edge and outwards by an outflow edge.
Hydrologically, catchment area refers to the area having a common outlet
for its runoff. Through generalization, HY_CatchmentArea inherits the
shape and the realizedCatchment properties. The optional shape
of the catchment may be implemented as a surface.




The HY_HydroNetwork feature type realizes a catchment as a network of
connected hydrologic features. Such a network realizes the hierarchical
network of logically connected catchments contained in a larger
catchment. It may be a sequence of flowpaths, an aggregate of catchment
areas or a mesh of catchment divides. HY_HydroNetwork feature type
specializes HY_CatchmentRealization. Through generalization it inherits
the shape, the realizedCatchment properties, and carries the
associations flowpath, catchmentDivide and catchmentArea. The
optional shape of the HY_HydroNetwork is usually given through the
individual geometries of the network parts.

The HY_CartographicRealization feature type realizes a catchment as a set
of separate cartographic layers or maps, displaying a network of
hydrologic features which may be connected at the representation level,
or not. Specializing HY_CatchmentRealization, it inherits through
generalization the shape attribute and the realizedCatchment
association.






Hydro Location


The HY_HydroLocation feature type (Figure 35) conceptualizes
the idea that a hydro nexus can be realized by practically any feature of
interest. The hydro nexus concept is used to define the hydrologic
determination of a catchment but, like the catchment concept, does not
have inherent realization(s). Any hydrologically significant feature
that can be identified as (said to be) the outlet of a catchment may
realize the hydro nexus. Typically, this will be a permanent, stable
location that is fixed and/or referenced by coordinates.




Landmarks such as confluences, points corresponding to vertical
sections, or the position of a monitoring station on a river are typical
realizations of the hydro nexus. Other kinds of hydro nexus realizations
that don’t carry normal surface water characteristics as defined in this
standard, e.g. a spring where groundwater enters the surface, an
arbitrary point projected onto the surface, or a nexus that collects
many disjoint locations may use or specialize the general
HY_HydroLocation type.




Topologically, the HY_HydroLocation should be understood to be the
boundary of the corresponding catchment, and always of lower topological
dimension than the catchment. Even though the topological realization of
a hydro nexus is typically as a node between catchment edges, a nexus
realization may also have any geometric representation, including a
single point.




In many cases, HY_HydroLocations are known but corresponding catchments
and hydro nexuses are not defined. For example, stream gages that are
part of a catchment dataset whose hydro nexus features are realized by
confluences. Both the stream gages and confluences are
HY_HydroLocations, but the stream gages' hydro nexus features are not
defined. Using this concept, HY_HydroLocation is expected to be used to
link between datasets that have catchments delineated for different
HY_HydroLocations.

HY_HydroLocation carries two attributes: shape and

7.3.3. The River Referencing model


The River Referencing model (Figure 36) provides a simple
model to place a feature of interest 'on a river.' It introduces the concept
of indirect position where a position is determined relative to an already
established reference location. This model defines a linear river
referencing system whose linear shape is given by a flowpath realizing
the catchment between its inflow and outflow. It is important to note
that each catchment has its own reference system, which defines the
start (origin) and the orientation of the linear flowpath (axis) along
which the distance from a known referent can be measured. An
implementation SHOULD unambiguously specify whether the direction of the
measure (from referent) is with the catchment-specific orientation of
the flowpath, or opposite to this.








Figure 36. River Referencing (UML class diagram)




The River Referencing system uses the one-dimensional topological
realization of catchment within the implied hydrologic complex such that
the feature to be placed and the reference location are (located) on the same flowpath. Given that a flowpath realizes a catchment between inflow and outflow nodes, the feature of interest is
placed some distance along a flowpath, while the location being used as
a reference location is located at the upstream or downstream end of the
flowpath. Using located referents in both directions allows placement of
a feature of interest a percentage of the distance along a flowpath even
if the realized catchment is not explicitly delineated.




Indirect Position


The HY_IndirectPosition feature type defines the location referenced
along an axis, without the necessity of a geometric realization.
Indirect position uses a catchment-specific reference system which
defines the flowpath as the required linear element along which the
position is determined. The indirect position is then expressed as the
distance from the upstream and/or downstream end of the flowpath, or
from a referent that is already located on that flowpath.




The (indirect) position of an outflow node referenced along an upstream
oriented flowpath (Figure 17) can be expressed as the
distance from an upstream inflow node located on that flowpath, while
the (indirect) position of an inflow node referenced along a downstream
oriented flowpath (Figure 18) can be expressed as distance
from a downstream outflow node located on the flowpath. An 'intermediate'
position referencing known inflow and outflow nodes bounding a flowpath
at both ends (Figure 19) can be expressed as part of the
distance along the entire flowpath, measured from the upstream end of an
upstream flowpath, and/or from the downstream end of a downstream flowpath.
A position referencing an already referenced location on the flowpath can be
expressed as part of the distance along the entire flowpath, measured
from the 'located referent'.




HY_IndirectPosition carries the distanceExpression, and
distanceDescription attributes, and has linearElement,
locatedReferent and referenceLocation associations. A
point-referent constraint emphasizes the topological relationship
between the linear element and point representation of the reference
location and a measure-along-flowpath constraint defines the flowpath as
the linear element to be used whenever a position is expressed as a
distance from a referent.

7.4. Surface Hydro Feature concepts


The Surface Hydro Feature application schema provides common concepts of
hydrologic features occurring on the land surface and specifies the core
concepts defined in the abstract Hydro Feature application schema. This
will enable contextually linked information models to build
relationships between multiple realizations of the same catchments.
Typical realizations of the catchment concept and hydro nexuses can be
described in a consistent way using standard terminology for the
relationships between surface water features defined in this application
schema.








Figure 37. Surface Hydro Feature - Application Schema Diagram




The Surface Hydro Feature model (Figure 37) conceptualizes the
accumulation of water on the land surface in waterbodies (shown in
Blue), each made unique by its origin, size, or movement. With respect
to the management and storage of water resources, a concept of water
storage is provided and allows any waterbody type to be considered a
managed reservoir (shown in Purple).




Relying on a conceptual separation of waterbody and container, the
Surface Hydro Feature schema defines a network of potentially connected
depressions and channels on the land surface which periodically or
continuously contain water (shown in Orange). Separate from the
hydrographic network of permanent or temporary waterbodies, the channel
network can be used as the connecting system.




The definitions in this schema are rooted in the definitions given in
the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology which defines a network of
watercourse regardless of the location in respect to the Earth’s
surface. The conceptual model defined here has been vetted in the
context of surface water hydrology. In other words, in this standard,
'channel network' and 'hydrographic network' refer to surface channels
or other containers for surface-waterbodies.




The Surface Hydro Feature application schema contains the leaf packages:
Channel Network, Hydrographic Network, Water Body Types and Storage.
Figure 38 shows the external and internal dependencies.








Figure 38. Surface Hydro Feature - dependencies




7.4.1. The Channel Network model


The Channel Network model defines a network of connected depressions and
channels which, in its entirety, can realize a catchment (Figure 39).
Usually this is a network of linear flowpaths realizing catchments
connected to each other within the containing catchment realized by the
entire network. This allows representation of the drainage pattern even
if logically connected features may or may not be connected in the
context of a particular representation.








Figure 39. Channel Network realizing the catchment (UML class diagram)




The channel network is defined independent of the hydrographic network.
This separates the concerns of hydraulics, focused on the analysis and
design of channels and conduits, from the concerns of hydrology, focused
on the occurrence and movement of water over land and in waterbodies. It
allows a catchment to be realized as a network of connected channels and
depressions, regardless of whether or not water is contained in them.




A single depression or channel may realize the catchment, either as part
of the network (Figure 39) or via a reference feature which
realizes the conceptual hydro nexus of the catchment
(Figure 40). For example, a
point at an associated cross or longitudinal section may be considered
to realize the outflow of the catchment which is realized by the channel
expressed as a flowpath.








Figure 40. Depression and Channel realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)




Channel Network


The HY_ChannelNetwork feature type specializes the HY_HydroNetwork
realization defined in the Hydro Feature core model, specifically as an
aggregate of surface depressions and surface channels which continuously
or periodically contain water, without imposing a particular drainage
pattern. This allows representation of the network, even if logically
connected features are not connected at the representation level. If the
realized catchment is connected with other catchments via hydro nexuses,
the channel network is considered to be connected to the channel networks
that realize these catchments.




HY_ChannelNetwork has surfaceDepression and surfaceChannel
associations, and carries a drainagePattern attribute; it inherits
through generalization the shape attribute, the realizedCatchment
association as well as flowpath, catchmentDivide and catchmentArea
associations. Depending on the application, the channel network and the
related features may be described by suitable attributes. A
channel-flowpath constraint is defined to support the recognition of
the channel as flowpath realizing the catchment.

The HY_Depression feature type specializes the general HY_HydroFeature
class. It describes land lower than the surrounding land as a container
for standing water. A depression is part of the network of channels and
depressions forming the connecting system in which waterbodies are
contained as parts of a hydrographic network. Through generalization,
HY_Depression inherits the name property. It has associations for the
surfaceNetwork in which it participates, a body of standingWater and
a stratum of a confinedWaterBody. An outlet-at-benchmark constraint
emphasizes that a benchmark on the confined waterbody at the outlet of
the catchment that is realized by the channel network.

Channel


The HY_Channel feature type specializes the HY_Depression class with
respect to a natural or man-made, open or closed channel through or
along which water may or may not flow. A channel is part of the network
of channels and depressions which forms the connecting system for the
hydrographic network; a channel may have vertical sections at right
angles to the main (average) direction of flow or along its centerline.




HY_Channel has an association indicating the channelNetwork in which
it participates. It carries the associations: stream,
bedProfileTransversal and bedProfileLongitudinal. HY_Channel
inherits from generalization the confinedWaterBody association and the
outflow-at-benchmark constraint. An outlet-at-profile constraint
emphasizes the recognition of vertical section as the outlet of the
catchment that is realized by the channel network.

7.4.2. The Hydrographic Network model


The Hydrographic Network model defines a logical network of waterbodies
which, in its entirety, realizes a catchment (Figure 41). Most
typically, this is as a network of linear flowpaths realizing catchments
connected to each other within a containing catchment that is realized
by the entire network. This allows representation of the network of
'blue lines', even if logically connected features are not connected at
the representation level.




The hydrographic network is defined independent of the channel network.
This maintains a conceptual separation of concerns of hydrology studying
the occurrence, accumulation, and circulation of water and studies
related to containers of waterbodies. It allows realization of the
catchment as a network of moving or standing waterbodies, regardless of
the channels and depressions.




A single waterbody can realize its catchment either as part of the
hydrographic network (Figure 41), or via a reference
location which realizes the hydro nexus of the catchment realized by
the waterbody (Figure 42).
For example, a fixed landmark, or a point at an associated
cross section is considered to realize the outflow of the catchment
which is realized by the waterbody.








Figure 41. Hydrographic Network realizing the catchment (UML class diagram)




Hydrographic Network


The HY_HydrographicNetwork feature type specializes the HY_HydroNetwork
realization defined in the Hydro Feature core model, specifically as an
aggregate of permanent or temporary bodies of water standing in depressions or
moving in channels. If the realized catchment is connected with other
catchments via hydro nexuses, the hydrographic network is considered
connected to the network realizing these catchments. This allows
representation of the network, even if logically connected features are
not connected at the representation level. If required, an application
focused on surface-waterbodies contained in channels or depressions may
use the defined relationships to describe the realization of a catchment
by the hydrographic network, or network parts associated with the
channel network.




HY_HydrographicNetwork has a networkWaterBody association. Through
generalization, it inherits the shape attribute and the
realizedCatchment association as well as flowpath, catchmentDivide
and catchmentArea associations. A waterbody-flowpath constraint
supports the recognition of the waterbody as a flowpath realizing the
catchment.

or along, the waterbody using a centerline as shape.
	
Constraint





 











Water Body


The HY_WaterBody feature type specializes the general HY_HydroFeature
class. A waterbody is part of the hydrographic network and is either
standing in a depression or flowing in a channel, which are parts of the
channel network. A waterbody may be segmented in vertical sections at
right angles to the main (average) direction of flow or along its
centerline, and horizontal strata. Conceptually, each waterbody, or a
stratum, could be thought of as a reservoir used for storage, regulation
or control of water recourses.








Figure 42. Water Body realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)




Through generalization, HY_WaterBody inherits the name property. It
has associations for the hydrographicNetwork in which it participates,
the containing waterpool and watercourse, the vertical
streamCrossSection, streamLongitudinalSection, a horizontal
stratum, and a reservoir for storage of water. Outlet-at-section
and outlet-at-landmark constraints emphasize the recognition of a
fixed landmark as outlet of the catchment realized by hydrographic
network.

Water-Body Stratum


The HY_WaterBodyStratum feature type describes a horizontal layer in a
stratified waterbody determined by differences in thermal or salinity
characteristics or by oxygen or nutrient content, or by virtual storage
zones of a reservoir. HY_WaterBodyStratum carries the properties:
stratumType and benchmark.

catchment realized by the waterbody.



	Association






Cross-Section and Longitudinal Section


The HY_CrossSection and HY_LongitudinalSection feature types
conceptualize the segmentation of a waterbody or a containing channel
through vertical sections. Taking into account the conceptual separation
of a watercourse, the cross section concept refers to both the cross
section of a waterbody orthogonal to the direction of flow, and to the
transversal bed profile of a channel. The longitudinal section concept
refers to both the vertical section of a waterbody along its centerline,
and to the longitudinal bed profile of a channel.




Both types of vertical section associate crossSectionPoint and
longitudalinalSectionPoint which should be used to identify a
permanent reference location at a vertical section which realizes the
conceptual hydro nexus of the catchment realized by the associated
channel or waterbody.






Water-LiquidPhase and Water-SolidPhase


The HY_Water_LiquidPhase and HY_Water_SolidPhase feature types provide
simple concepts of the accumulation of water in waterbodies. This
definition refers to the matter accumulated to a mass of water. In its
liquid form water is considered accumulated in waterbodies; in its solid
phase water may be accumulated after melting, or as a layer of ice or
snow on an open waterbody. The accumulation of water in the atmosphere
or below the land surface, e.g. rain, soil moisture or groundwater, is
not in scope of this standard, as well as the accumulation of snow and
ice in glaciers which is the subject of glaciology science.




Contextually related information models may use the HY_Water_LiquidPhase
and HY_Water_SolidPhase feature types to build relationships to an
accumulating waterbody, and ultimately to the catchment realized either
by the waterbody or by the network of which the waterbody is part.




HY_Water_LiquidPhase has an association with the
accumulatingWaterBody; HY_Water_SolidPhase has associations with the
water from snowmelt and coveredWaterBody. These associations may be
used to identify the waterbody (as part of the hydrographic network)
where liquid water is accumulated.





 










7.4.3. The Surface-Water Body types


The Surface Water model defines typical specializations of a waterbody
on the land surface. Being a specialization of the HY_WaterBody class
each subtype inherits the stratum, waterpool, watercourse,
upstreamWaterBody, downstreamWaterBody, fixedLandmark,
streamCrossSection and streamLongitudinalSection properties. From
the general HY_HydroFeature class specialized waterbodies inherit the
name property, which allows the handling of names given to them in
cross-jurisdiction and multi-lingual contexts. Each specialization is
understood to be part of the hydrographic network. There may be other
contexts with other specializations, or where a particular segmentation
exists, that does not conform to the types defined in this standard.




The HY_River feature type defines the existence of a body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, which is special due to its
property to permanently or temporarily flow.




The HY_Canal feature type defines the existence of a body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, that is special due to its
artificial origin (man-made).




The HY_Lake feature type defines the existence of a body of surface water,
participating in a hydrographic network, made special due to its considerable
size.




The HY_Impoundment feature type defines the existence of a body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, seen as being special due to
being formed by collecting water, for example in the case of a dam.




The HY_Lagoon feature type defines the existence of a body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, which is special due to its
shallow depth and interaction with the open sea.




The HY_Estuary feature type defines the existence of a body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, made special due to branching
and its interaction with the open sea.






7.4.4. The Storage model


The Storage model (Figure 43) provides a concept to describe
any waterbody, in terms of a reservoir storing water for future use. The
separation of the storage model allows for description of the hydrographic
network without the details of storage capacities that a waterbody may
have, and conversely, storage reservoirs can also be described independent
of their role within the hydrographic network.








Figure 43. Reservoir realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)




The HY_Reservoir feature type describes the waterbody, either natural or
man-made, used for storage, regulation and control of water resources.
The reservoir concept refers to a volume of water managed in zones
between operating levels. HY_Reservoir has associations between a
reservoir and the storedWaterBody and a reservoirZone.

7.5. Hydrometric Network concepts


The Hydrometric Network application schema (Figure 44
and Figure 45) define a logical
model to take into account a network of hydrometric stations as a
specific realization of the catchment in the perspective of hydrologic
observation, without the detail of an observation strategy.




The Hydrometric Network model specifies the concepts defined in the
Hydro Feature core model. The general concept is that of a network of
logically connected hydrometric stations realizing as a whole the
catchment. This enables contextually related information models to
relate monitoring stations and observing posts to hydrologic features,
as is often required for environmental reporting or when interpreting,
analyzing and processing observation results.








Figure 44. Hydrometric Network - dependencies




The hydrometric network model introduces the concept of a 'position on
river' which allows a hydrologic station, which may not have a precisely
known location, to be the located on a river. This supports the
establishment of upstream-downstream relationships between hydrometric
features, assignment of a position relative to a 'fixed' hydro nexus, or
to place other features of interest relative to the hydrometric station.

7.5.1. Hydrometric Network model


The HY_HydrometricNetwork feature type specializes the HY_HydroNetwork
realization specifically as an aggregate of hydrometric features.

realizedCatchment, flowpath, catchmentDivide and catchmentArea
associations.

hydrometricNetwork in which it participates, and a positionOnRiver.

monitoring station as the outlet of the catchment that is realized by the
hydrometric network.

Annex C: HY_Features  - AHGF Mapping



This is a descriptive mapping for the Australian Hydrological Geospatial
Fabric (AHGF) [11]. It is intended to provide an understanding of the
basic relationship of HY_Features concepts and the AHGF hydrologic
feature implementation.




C.1. Catchment Model

	HY_Features Name
	AHGF Name/Class
	Comment

	HY_Catchment
	Contracted Catchment


'Base-level' Catchment
	A contracted catchment is a catchment identified via ConCatID, which
conceptualizes a holistic unit of hydrology draining to a common outflow
(HY_HydroNexus) with a known identity to which a persistent identifier
is assigned (ConNodeID). This logical catchment may also have a single
inflow, which together with the outflow, define a FlowPath for the
catchment and take part in the AHGF topology tables
(AHGFNodeLinkConnectivityDown and AHGFNodeLinkConnectivityUp). A
catchment may have multiple hydrologic-realizations and is therefore not
restricted to the single geometric representation given by
AHGFContractedCatchment.


Additionally, AHGF 'base-level' catchments, from which contracted
catchments are derived, can be seen as a second set of conceptualized
units of hydrology draining to a single common outflow and with a single
inflow. These catchments are attributed with a non-persistent identifier (HydroID)
and like contracted catchments, their flow paths take part in AHGF
topology tables (AHGFNetworkConnectivityDown and
AHGFNetworkConnectivityUp). The polygon geometric representation of
these catchments is provided by AHGFCatchment.

	HY_DendriticCatchment
	Contracted Catchment

Subsets of 'Base-level' Catchments
	All contracted catchment
features are constrained to be dendritic in the AHGF. A contracted
catchment’s outflow can only be received by a single downstream
contracted catchment.

While sub-sets of AHGF base-level catchments may be dendritic, these catchments are not constrained in the same way as contracted catchments and thus contain non-dendritic relationships.

	HY_InteriorCatchment
	Contracted Catchment


Subset of 'Base-level' Catchments
	Contracted catchments that normally do not contribute flow to a
neighboring contracted catchment or to the coast (i.e. catchments with
potential connections to groundwater or atmospheric systems).

'Base-level' catchments that normally do not contribute flow to a
neighboring base-level catchment or to the coast. These catchments have
no realized FlowPath or HydroNexus.

	HY_CatchmentAggregate
	Collections of Contracted Catchment


Collections of 'Base-level' Catchments
	Sets of non-overlapping dendritic and interior contracted catchment
features aggregated into larger encompassing catchments. Such
aggregations are a fundamental concept in the AHGF and a primary
reason for the creation of the contracted catchments. The AHGF
Topographic Drainage Divisions (AWRADrainageDivision) and River Regions
(RiverRegions) are examples of such aggregations.


Contracted catchments, derived from collections of 'base-level'
catchments, can themselves be seen as further examples of a catchment
aggregate.

	HY_HydroNexus
	Subset of Contracted Node

AHGFNetworkNode
	A hydrologic significant
entity conceptualizing the outflow of a Contracted Catchment. All
contracted nodes in the AHGF are determined by a set of defined business
rules and assigned with persistent identifiers (ConNodeID). A subset of
these contracted nodes act in the role of outflow node (ConNodeID) for
one or more contracted catchment(s) and can also act as an inflow node
(FConNodeID) for zero or one contracted catchment.

Inflow (FromNode) and outflow (ToNode) nodes of 'Base-level' catchments with a realized FlowPath.

	HY_HydroLocation
	AHGFNode


AHGFNetworkNode
	Features in AHGFNode are the subset of contracted nodes, which realize
instances of HY_HydroNexus for contracted catchments. All AHGFNode features therefore act in the role of an outflow node (ConNodeID) for a contracted catchment and may
additionally act in the role of inflow node (FConNodeID) for a
single contracted catchment. Some examples of contracted nodes that
realize hydro nexus in the AHGF are confluences, coastal outlets,
reservoir outlets and monitoring point stream gauges. The AHGF also
defines a specialization of HY_HydroLocation, whereby a collection of
disjoint points (nodes from AHGFNetworkNode) can be used to realize a single nexus, effectively
forming a 'diffused' outflow (or inflow) for a contracted catchment.
Instances of such specialized hydro locations, which are used for
simplification of complex drainage patterns at the boundaries of
contracted catchments, will always include one contracted
node. This representative node is the node used for topological
realization of the corresponding hydro nexus.


AHGFNetworkNode features are further examples of hydro
locations in the AHGF. These are representative outflow (To_Node) and inflow (From_Node) nodes for AHGF 'Base-level' catchments with a realized FlowPath and include the remaining contracted nodes not included in AHGFNode.

	HY_CatchmentRealization
	Feature identified by ConCatID
	Any feature, collection of features or topological data identified by a
single ConCatID (contracted catchment). Single instances of
AHGFContractedCatchment and AHGFLink as well as collections of
AHGFNetworkStream, AHGFNetworkNode, AHGFCatchment and AHGFWaterbody features sharing a common ConCatID.



Note: features of subtype AHGFContractedCatchment::NoFlowArea in the
AHGF are special-case unrealized contracted catchments (normally
small islands) that do not have an associated contracted node (i.e. No
HY_HydroNexus).

 

All AHGF 'base-level' catchments have at least one catchment realization,
being a single instance of AHGFCatchment, and the majority are also realized by
a single AHGFNetworkStream.

	HY_CatchmentArea
	Not represented
	Although the polygon representing a catchment might be thought
of as an area, the subset of a DEM or another land cover dataset would
be more in line with the meaning of CatchmentArea as defined by
HY_Features.

Although not directly represented in the AHGF, the inherent close
relationship between the features of AHGFContractedCatchment,
AHGFCatchment and the DEM (9 second or 1 second) from which they are derived, allow us to postulate a potential realization of a contracted catchment or base-level catchment as the area of the DEM bounded by that contracted or base-level catchment.

	HY_CatchmentDivide
	AHGFContractedCatchment


AHGFCatchment
	The AHGFContractedCatchment polygon feature that realizes a contracted
catchment and represents the area of the land surface draining to the catchment’s outflow hydro nexus.


The AHGFCatchment polygon feature that realizes a base-level catchment and represents the area of the land surface draining to the catchment’s outflow.

	HY_CartographicRealization
	AHGFMappedStream
	The features of AHGFMappedStream within the AHGF Surface Cartography product,
provide a further realization of both contracted catchments and base-level
catchments. These features, along with the other features in the AHGF Surface Hydrology product are specifically aimed to support cartographic realizations of contracted and base-level catchments. Collections of features from AHGFNetworkStream identified by
a single ConCatID, while a realization of a contracted catchment
themselves, are also attributed with identifiers (AusHydroID) that relate them to corresponding mapped stream features.

	AHGFNetworkStream (subtypes: NetworkFlowSegment & NetworkWaterAreaSegment)

AHGFWaterbody

AHGFMappedStream (subtypes: MappedFlowSegment & MappedWaterAreaSegment)
	The collection of AHGFNetworkStream flow segment and water area segment features and on-network AHGFWaterbody features within a particular contracted catchment (identified by a single ConCatID) can be seen to realize that catchment as its hydrographic network.

Similarly, collections of AHGFMappedStream flow segment and water area segment features (related to AHGFNetworkStream via AusHydroID) together with on-network AHGFWaterbody features, provide an alternative (cartographic) representation of a hydrographic network in the AHGF.

	HY_WaterBody
	AHGFNetworkStream
(subtypes: NetworkFlowSegment & NetworkWaterAreaSegment)

AHGFWaterbody

AHGFMappedStream
(subtypes: MappedFlowSegment & MappedWaterAreaSegment)
	AHGFNetworkStream flow segment and water area segment features and
AHGFWaterbody features represent water bodies in the AHGF. These
features indicate that there is water contained in some channel or other
containing feature.

Again, alternative representations of waterbody features are provided by the AHGF Surface Cartography product. In addition to flow segment and water area segment features of AHGFMappedStream, there are a number of other feature classes providing represenations of waterbodies as points, polylines and polygons.

	HY_ChannelNetwork
	AHGFNetworkStream
	When AHGFNetworkStream artificial flow segment features are combined with flow segment and water area segment features, this forms the equivalent of a complete channel network in the AHGF. The collection of such features within a particular contracted catchment (identified by a single ConCatID) can be seen to realize that catchment as its channel network.

Note: AHGFMappedStream artificial flow segment features are NOT equivalent to those in AHGFNetworkStream and have a different usage.

	HY_Depression
	Not represented
	Artificial flow segment features of AHGFNetworkStream are depressions in the land surface, as derived from a particular digital elevation model, where water would theoretically accumulate and flow along channels, connecting up with flow segments and water area segments to form a complete network.

	HY_Channel
	AHGFNetworkStream
(subtype: NetworkArtificialFlowSegment)
	Artificial flow segment features from AHGFNetworkStream represent depressions in the land surface (according to particular digital elevation model) where water may flow, even though not normally present. When combined with the other features from the same feature class, this allows representation of the entire logical network, from source to sink (e.g. headwaters to coast).

	HY_Reservoir
	AHGFWaterbody
(subtype: Reservoir)
	Features from AHGFWaterbody with the subtype reservoir. A subset of these features have additional attribution linking them to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Water Storage product.

	HY_FlowPath
	AHGFLink
	Each link feature in AHGFLink realizes a contracted catchment identified
by a single ConCatID. A link is essentially a straight line linking
HY_HyrdoLocation features (AHGFNode), which are represetations of realized
HY_HydroNexus (contracted nodes). Links connect the contracted catchments inflow node to its outflow node.

Note: The AHGF currently does not have FlowPath features for contracted
catchments in headwater areas. Such catchments have no represetative inflow node.

	HY_HydrometricNetwork
	AHGFNode
(subtype: GhostNode)

AHGFGhostNode
	In the AHGF, hydrometric features are the combination of AHGFGhostNode features and those AHGFNode ghost node features that realize contracted nodes representing hydrometric stations. Thus, from a AHGF perpective, a hydrometric network can be seen as the collection of logically connected hydrometric ghost node features (from both classes), which provides a specific realization of a contracted catchment (that monitors that catchment).

	HY_HydrometricFeature
	AHGFNode
(subtype: GhostNode)

AHGFGhostNode
	Hydrometric features in the AHGF are ghost node monitoring locations that realize contracted catchments either seperately (AHGFNode ghost nodes), or as part of a hydrometric network (AHGFGhostNode + AHGFNode ghost nodes). AHGFNode ghost node features are hydrometric features that act in the role of inflow and outflow hydro nexus for contracted catchments. Ghost node features of the AHGFGhostNode class are reference locations for hydrometric stations for which a hydro nexus has not (yet) been defined.

Note: While hydrometric features were included in earlier versions of
the AHGF, version 3 products were the first to see them included as
realizations acting in the role of inflow and
outflow hydro nexus for contracted catchments.

	HY_IndirectPosition
	Not represented
	Measures are not explicitly included in the AHGF. Note however, that representative locations (AHGFGhostNode) for hydrometric stations without a corresponding hydro nexus are provided 'on river'. Thus, indirect position, as for example, a percentage of distance from a (inflow/outflow) referent along a flowpath, would be relatively straightforward to generate for said features.












Annex D: HY_Features - NHDPlus  Mapping



This is a descriptive mapping for the USGS National Hydrography Dataset
Plus (NHDPlus) [10]. It is intended to provide an understanding of the
basic relationship of HY_Features concepts and the NHDPlus hydrologic
feature implementation.

	HY_Catchment
	comid catchment
	The comid catchment is the feature that
takes part in PlusFlow topology table, has associated accumulated
characteristics, etc. Could also be the collection of catchments that
contribute to a given reachcode reach, HUC watershed outlet, or another
identifiable watershed outlet. Not necessarily the catchment polygon
features, but more generally, the unit of hydrology represented by
catchment polygons and other data keyed to the comid.

	HY_DendriticCatchment
	comid catchment
	NHDPlus catchments not
following any diversions in the flow tables.

	HY_InteriorCatchment
	comid catchment
	NHDPlus catchments that do not
contribute flow.

	HY_CatchmentAggregate
	collection of comid catchments
	Including
interior catchments and not following diversions in the flow tables.

	HY_HydroNexus
	fromNode or toNode
	NHDPlus nodes are inflow (fromNode)
and outflow (toNode) nodes of a given comid catchment.

	HY_HydroLocation
	fromNode or toNode location, point location of point
events, etc.
	HY_HydroLocation can be used as a reference location for
any point associated with a feature. Typically, this is for hydro nexus
locations and monitoring locations, but may be used for many other
feature types. The downstream end and upstream end of an NHDPlus
flowline would be considered the hydro location of a hydro nexus.

	HY_CatchmentRealization
	Any entity that is identified by a comid
	In
NHDPlus, the comid identifies an unrealized catchment. Any geometric or
topologic data that is referenced to a comid can be said to realize that
catchment. This includes upstream aggregations of the network or
catchment areas that form complete watersheds.

	HY_CatchmentArea
	Not Represented
	While the polygon representing a
catchment might be thought of as an area, the subset of a DEM or another
land cover dataset would be more in line with the meaning of
CatchmentArea.

	HY_CatchmentDivide
	comid catchment polygon
	The polygon representing a
comid catchment should be thought of as the CatchmentDivide.

	HY_CartographicRealization
	A map of a catchment
	The NHDPlus dataset
doesn’t include any, but if a map view of a catchment is created at any
scale, it could be said to be a cartographic realization of a catchment.

	HY_HydrographicNetwork
	collection of flowlines and waterbodies
	The
collection of perennial and ephemeral flowlines as well as so-called
double line streams and on-network lakes within any collection of
catchments (an HY_Catchment) can be considered its hydrographic network.

	HY_WaterBody
	Perennial flowlines and waterbodies
	Perennial flowlines
are thought to represent waterbodies as well as waterbody polygons that
represent wide streams and lakes. These features indicate that there is
water contained in some channel or other container.

	HY_ChannelNetwork
	Not represented
	
	HY_Depression
	Not represented
	
	HY_Channel
	Ephemeral flowlines.
	While NHD doesn’t have an explicit
channel concept, ephemeral flowlines can be thought of as a channel in
that they indicate that water can flow there, but may not be present in
the flowline container at all times.

	HY_Reservoir
	waterbodies that are reservoirs
	Any waterbody that can
be categorized as a reservoir in that it is a waterbody that has a
management regime.

	HY_FlowPath
	flowlines and reaches
	A flowline (or reach) is a linear
representation of the catchment (or collection of catchments associated
with a reach) it shares an id with. For NHD Events, the reachcode reach
is the flowpath because it is the linear element used for linear
referencing.

Annex E: HY_Features-INSPIRE Hydrography Theme



This table assigns core features as defined in the INSPIRE Hydrography
theme [2] to HY_Features core concepts. It also indicates relationships
between both terms and potential conditions by which they can be
associated.




This table should not be understood in terms of a 'conceptual mapping'
of clearly defined relationships between two logical concepts, but
rather as a simple approach to show compatibility of concepts, based on
the meaning expressed in the definitions, and without imposing a
particular implementation. Since each data set that implements the
INSPIRE theme will have a different legacy of documentation and
information modeling, a conceptual mapping would be expressed
differently.  Applications implementing the INSPIRE Hydrography theme
can use this listing to understand how a particular dataset may relate
to the HY_Features concepts. 




Note that in INSPIRE a base 'HydroObject' concept has been defined. Many of the
INSPIRE hydrography Features mentioned below are a specialization of this concept. Thus, they inherit a hydroid attribute which targets the topic of
multiple representations of the same object: 'An identifier that is
used to identify a hydrographic object in the real world. It provides a
'key' for implicitly associating different representations of the
object.'

	HY_Catchment
	work unit, or Water Survey of Canada Drainage Areas, Sub-Drainage Areas
and Sub-Sub Drainage Areas
	1356 work units covering Canada have been defined. The Water Survey of
Canada has redefined these as a hierarchy with sub-sub-drainage areas
corresponding to the work units. The sub-sub-drainage areas are roughly
comparable to HUC-8’s in the NHD. Catchments are also being defined
based on best available data for each of roughly 2200 water gauge
stations across Canada; however, initially these catchments will not
always be aligned to the NHN. So in practical terms, Canada does not
have an equivalent to a HY_Catchment, with its membership in a catchment
coverage and its integrated relationship to a hydrographic network.
(However, British Columbia’s Freshwater Atlas (FWA) does have complete
coverage of reach catchments, which were determined algorithmically; the
FWA was the source for NHN in BC. Ontario has also developed catchment
capabilities based on user provided points on a stream.)

	HY_HydrographicNetwork
	Waterbodies and single line watercourses that correspond to a collection
of network linear flows.
	The waterbodies and single-line watercourses all have corresponding
network linear flows (double-line streams and lakes are waterbodies
that are also realized by skeleton lines, which are considered as
inferred network linear flows). As noted earlier though, the NHN networks
are not tied to catchments or aggregations of catchments.

	HY_WaterBody
	Waterbodies and single line watercourses.
	Waterbody is used specifically for hydrographic features that are
represented by polygons: lakes and double-line streams, defined by banks
and delimiters. Single-line watercourses also fall under HY_WaterBody.
