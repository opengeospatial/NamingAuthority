i. Preface 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of more 
than 300+ companies, government agencies, and universities participating in a consensus 
process to develop publicly available geo-processing specifications. This Best Practices 
document is a product of the OGC Web Services 2 Initiative (OWS).  The objective of 
OWS-2 was to provide a vendor-neutral interoperable framework for the web-based 
discovery and exploitation of geo-processing functions. 

The OGC Web Services Initiative is part of the OGC’s Interoperability Program: a 
global, collaborative, hands-on engineering and testing program designed to deliver 
prototype technologies and proven candidate specifications into the OGC’s Specification 
Development Program. In OGC Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of 
technology providers work together to solve specific geo-processing interoperability 
problems posed by Initiative sponsors.

iv. Changes to the OpenGIS Abstract Specification 

No revisions to the OpenGIS Abstract Specification are required. 

v. Changes to OpenGIS Implementation Specifications 

As noted in Clause 9.2, revisions are suggested for the GML feature-encoding format.  
The GML format is defined in OGC document 03-105r1and others.  Specifically, the 
encoding of coordinate values needs to be simplified to using a list of numbers as defined 
by XML Schema for efficient number-array storage in Binary XML.

Introduction 

GML (Geography Markup Language) [GML], and other scientific-data formats, as 
presently encoded using plain-text XML [XML] have three major performance problems: 
the text in the XML structure is highly redundant and bulky, making it slow to transfer 
over the Internet; the lexical scanning of XML (turning free text into tokens for internal 
processing) is unexpectedly costly; and the conversion of text-encoded numerical 
coordinate and observation values is also very costly. 

GML encoding file size can be reduced by using general compression methods such as 
GZIP [GZIP]. However, this does not address the scanning and numeric-conversion 
costs.  XML generally compresses quite well, since it is so redundant; repeated blocks of 
text (such as closing tags) compress down to practically nothing.  However, scanning-
cost and further space reductions can be achieved by using a binary encoding method for 
the XML representation plus a minor change to the method for specifying coordinate 
values. 

The binary encoding method mirrors the typical in-memory representation of XML as 
nodes in a parse tree by representing the stream as a sequence of node-equivalent 
‘tokens’.  There are tokens defined to represent element openings, closings (necessary 
here unlike in a tree), empty elements, in-line content, entity references, special tags, and 
even comments.  The byte lengths of various structures are given in advance at the head 
of their byte sequences for efficient processing, and element/attribute names are 
represented as integer indexes into a global symbol/string table, for both space and time 
efficiency. 

There are also special, efficient representations available for content and attribute values 
that represent numbers or arrays of numbers.  This is crucially important to use with 
GML for coordinate values.  The existing GML representations of using special-
character-delimited sequences of textual numbers or of using hierarchical structures for 
coordinate values should either be scrapped or be augmented by using an XML-Schema 
[XMLSCHEMA] ‘list’ representation of ‘double’ values.  This type can be 
represented and processed very efficiently using a raw array of IEEE ‘double’ floating-
point numbers. 

This raw list can be read straight into an array in memory and be used directly by all 
modern processors with at most a swapping of the byte order (endian) of the values.  No 
costly parsing or conversion of the coordinate values is necessary with an efficient 
programming language.  This direct numeric representation by itself would make GML 
practically as efficient to use as any other feature-encoding format, such as ESRI® 
Shapefile format [SHAPE]. 

The binary-encoding method can also directly represent raw binary data without any 
indirect textual-encoding methods (such as base64), and a backward-compatibility 
mechanism is provided to enable the translation raw-binary blocks into an equivalent 
textual representation when necessary.  Binary XML also can be compressed using

general compression methods, though it will already be significantly smaller and less 
redundant that text encoding. 

This binary-encoding method is applicable to all XML documents and not just GML and 
scientific-data formats, though many XML documents are not necessarily bulky enough 
to benefit greatly from binary encoding.  The binary encoding is directly equivalent to the 
textual encoding and it is possible to translate any lone XML document to and from the 
binary representation with no loss of information.  The binary stream is also parseable 
and generable sequentially on-the-fly, as textual XML is, but optional indexing and 
direct-random-access capabilities (e.g., of “ID” attributes) are also available.

5.3 Binary-structure declarations 

The binary structures in this document are described using a declaration language modelled 
after C/C++ and derived programming languages.  The declarations have the following forms 
for structures, enumerated data types, and union data types: 

structure_name { 
    data_type   field_name;      // optional comment 
    data_type   array_name[array_size]; 
    … 
} 

integer_type enum enum_name { 
    identifier1 = value1,        // optional comment 



03-002r9

14 

    … 
} 

union union_name { 
    sub_type1,                   // optional comment 
    … 
} 

This format is well-suited toward describing binary structures and should be obvious to 
anyone who writes software.  The fields in the structure definition are byte-packed; i.e., fields 
are not aligned on word boundaries.  Unions are byte-packed for the sub-type used. 

6 WAP binary XML 

A binary encoding for XML was developed for the WAP environment [WAPXML].  It was 
designed for use in a limited environment and has some design problems with primitive 
encoding, content encoding, and tag representation. 

Numeric and string primitives are encoded in awkward ways that make them less efficient to 
parse.  Only the representation of unsigned integers is provided and they are encoded with a 
variable-length string of only seven active bits within bytes.  The most-significant bit of each 
byte is used as a continuation marker from one byte to another.  This is inefficient because 
the input stream must be scanned a single byte at a time to extract the value and it is awkward 
to handle since the seven bits that constitute part of the result number must be extracted and 
shifted into position in the result in a bit-wise fashion.  A more efficient method would 
identify the type of number being encoded up-front and would then represent the number in 
its common raw-binary format.  More numeric types than just unsigned integers are also 
needed, plus arrays of numbers. 

Strings are represented as a raw sequence of bytes with no length or standard terminator.  
This information must be interpreted from whatever character-encoding method is used.  For 
example, with UTF-8, a null-terminator character (single-byte code 0x00) is used to delimit 
the end of a string.  In addition to being awkward to deal with, this method is inefficient to 
process since the incoming stream must be scanned a single character at a time in order to 
locate the terminator for each string.  A more efficient method would be to encode the byte 
length before the string so that the string content can be handled as a contiguous block. 

All content in WAP is represented as strings (or equivalently as string references).  This does 
not facilitate efficient processing of GML coordinate or observation values. 

Tags in WAP-XML are may be represented as either literal strings or equivalently as string 
references.  Using string references allows more efficient processing, but the mandatory use 
of a special namespace of element/attribute identifiers would be more efficient for parsers. 

Finally, the WAP-XML specification does not address the issue of compression within itself.  
Compression is an important issue for efficient data transfer over the Internet.

7 Design overview 

This section discusses important overall design issues. 

7.1 File structure 

The representation used in BXML consists of a header followed by a stream of tokens.  The 
header contains the information necessary to identify and process the stream, and the tokens 
encode the content in discrete “packets” of information.  These tokens are sequenced in an 
order that makes the format “streamable”; i.e., so that it can be read and processed properly in 
sequential order.  This is important since data is normally passed as a sequential stream of 
bytes over the Internet. 

However, random access to the BXML data can be very useful also.  For example, if an XML 
file is used as a “database” of objects of some type with an “ID” attribute used as a primary 
key for the objects, then if only a few objects need to be accessed for a particular application, 
it will be greatly more efficient to randomly seek directly to the data tokens that encode those 
objects and to ignore the rest of the file. 

It is also crucially important for a BXML file to be able to be translated to and from the 
textual XML format with no loss of information.  Various systems may support only the 
textual XML format, so some mechanism will need to be employed to translate a BXML file 
before it can be processed.  Consequentially, a BXML file must also be able to stand alone, in 
the same way that a textual XML file can stand alone—not in the validation sense, but in the 
functionality sense.  The file must be parseable, by a non-validating parser at least, without 
dependence on external files or definitions.  A sensible way to achieve this is to have a one-
to-one correspondence between BXML content and XML constructs.  This also allows 
parsers to more easily support both formats.  However, some of the unfortunate compromises 
in textual XML with respect to character encoding and escaping are alleviated. 

7.2 The war of the endians 

The term “endian” comes from the Jonathan Swift novel Gulliver’s Travels [SWIFT] which 
contains a segment that describes a war between two peoples who could not agree whether to 
break open soft-boiled eggs starting with the big end or the little end.  That war continues 
today over the byte ordering of data words within computers, since different processor 
manufacturers use different byte-order endians. 

For BXML, the endian issue boils down to a matter of theory versus practice.  In theory, 
BXML should be defined to be big-endian only since this was selected as the “network 
order” presumably because it is easier for a human to read in a hexadecimal dump, if not 
because the computers that were first networked together happened to be big-endian.  This 
would slightly simplify the format.  However, in practice, probably most of the computers 
connected to the Internet are Intel®/AMD® x86-based Personal Computers, and always 
requiring the translation to and from big endian on these machines will make applications run 
less efficiently than they otherwise would. 



03-002r9

16 

The compromise selected for BXML format and used in other formats such as OGC WKB 
Simple Features [WKB-SF] is to allow a writer of the format to use either endian and to 
require the reader of the format to be able to handle both endians.  An indicator is written into 
the header of the file to tell which endian is used.  This allows greater efficiency to in the 
common case that a BXML file is shared between two machines that use the same endian, 
which may be quite likely within an organization and will always be the case when a file is 
generated and consumed on the same machine.  The LAN and local-machine cases are 
especially important to consider for this issue since the file will be transferred the most 
efficiently in this environment, making endian conversion have a greater relative impact on 
performance. 

7.3 Compression 

Compression of data is a very important capability for a data format that is intended to be 
streamed over the Internet.  This is because the bandwidth of the an Internet connection 
frequently will be a major bottleneck to performance in distributed data processing, and data 
can be compressed and decompressed at a low relative cost with modern computers. 

However, the difficult issue to decide is whether to specify that an external compression 
method optionally may be applied to a BXML stream, or whether the compression should be 
built-in.  With HTTP and perhaps other communication protocols, streamed data optionally 
may be compressed if the client requests compression and the server supports compression.  
However, in practice, this compression seems to be available and applied only haphazardly, 
and the benefits usually are not realized.  Also, if a data source is relatively static (written 
once and read many times), the compression step, if available, would be applied many times 
instead of only once. 

For these reasons, optional built-in compression is selected for use with BXML.  Writers may 
optionally support compression, but all readers are required to support decompression.  
However, a compressed BXML file is implemented as a non-compressed header followed by 
a compressed stream of bytes for the body.  This makes it easy for a reader that does not 
implement decompression directly to split off the BXML header and then run the file body 
through an external application that supports the compressed-stream format. 

Non-compressed BXML files are also allowed so that files may be accessed randomly and 
because compression will likely make processing less efficient in a LAN environment, 
because the network will be much less of a performance bottleneck, and processing will 
definitely be less efficient with a local file. 

The GZIP compression format [GZIP] is selected for use for the file-body compression 
stream.  GZIP is a ubiquitous, open, free, and patent-unencumbered general-purpose 
compressed-data format.  The format is supported by the ZLIB software library [ZLIB], 
which is a multi-platform, multi-computer-language, open-source, and free implementation 
of the GZIP format and the “Deflate” compression algorithm that is used within GZIP, ZIP, 
PNG, and other formats.  All BXML readers are required to support this compression format 
by some method.

7.4 String table 

There can be little doubt that a string/symbol table is very well suited for use with an XML 
document.  A great deal of lexical-scanning time is spent extracting and comparing symbol 
strings (e.g., element names) from text-based XML, and these symbols are also responsible 
for much of the bulk of the format.  The use of a string table allows all of the element and 
attribute names to be defined in an array and for the symbols to be referenced by merely 
using the integer index of the symbol string in the string table.  The use of an array also 
allows a reader (and a writer) to efficiently associate auxiliary information with the symbol 
names, such as a reference to an object that represents an XML namespace that is included in 
the symbol string or parsing/validation-state information. 

In addition to providing element, etc. symbol names, general strings that are repeatedly used 
in textual content also easily can be stored into the global string table.  This allows the 
uncompressed document to be smaller and perhaps to be processed more efficiently.  It is up 
to the discretion of the BXML writer which strings to use by reference and which to provide 
in-line.  WAP-XML also provides a general-string-table mechanism. 

A vexing issue with the use of a string table in a streaming format is whether to require that 
the string table to placed in its entirety at the front of the file stream, or whether to allow 
strings to be defined throughout the stream before they are used.  The former approach 
simplifies readers and allows random access to be supported more easily because all of the 
strings will be defined up-front.  The latter approach simplifies writers, since the 
symbols/strings that can be or will be used may not be known in the programming 
environment in advance. 

The spread-out string-table approach is selected for use in BXML.  However, it is required 
that the string table be (optionally) randomly accessible so that string references encountered 
when accessing a BXML file randomly may be resolved without first scanning the file 
sequentially (thereby defeating the benefits of random access).  Therefore, in BXML files 
that are designated as being randomly accessible, an index of all of the fragments of the string 
table is included so that the string-table references can be resolved in random order.  They 
may be resolved all at once or as needed. 

7.5 XML-content-string limitations 

Textual XML defines that various character strings must not contain certain literal characters 
or sequences because they are used as markup characters in the same context.  The characters 
and sequences with special limitations include “<”, “>”, “&”, “]]>”, “"”,  and “'” in various 
kinds of content.  These literal characters must be specially escaped when they appear in 
content, such as with “&lt;” for “<”.  The sequence of two hyphens (“--”) is also 
disallowed in comments. 

It has been decided that it would be awkward and wasteful to obey all of these unfortunate 
allowed-character constraints that XML places on its content structures.  Textual XML 
imposes these constraints to allow it to tokenize the text stream, but this consideration is 



03-002r9

18 

irrelevant in BXML because String content is length-encoded and the stream is tokenized 
in an “out-of-band” fashion.  Textual XML uses entity references to encode these special 
characters, but it is recognized here that these entities are semantically no more significant 
than just escape sequences, so the literal characters are allowed in BXML content tokens, 
with a few considerations.  Really, both reader and writer applications work more efficiently 
with the literal characters than with entities.  However, the equivalent entity structures still 
may be used at the discretion of the writer. 

However, there may be an issue if textual XML needs to be regenerated, then content strings 
will need to be scanned by the translator and special characters will need to be escaped using 
the entity-encoding method wherever the textual-XML definition requires it.  While this 
string scanning will make the process less efficient, this overhead will be insignificant 
compared to the costs of outputting the textual-XML representation and most likely re-
parsing it. 

On the other hand, if a traditional API is supplied on top of a BXML stream, it may not be 
known whether that application that is making use of the API needs to have special characters 
appear as entity constructs or whether it can handle literal strings.  For most applications, it 
will not matter, but if it does matter, then a special flag is provided in the file header to 
indicate whether content strings in the BXML file conform to the textual-XML constraints or 
whether they will need to be scanned for special characters. 

8 Representation 

This section defines the byte-for-byte representation of BXML files. 

8.1 Data-value encoding 

The following primitive numeric types are used in this specification: 

Name No. of Bits Base Type Range 
byte 8 unsigned integer 0 to 255 
short 16 signed integer -32768 to 32767 
ushort 16 unsigned integer 0 to 65535 
int 32 signed integer -231 to 231-1 
long 64 signed integer -263 to 263-1 
float 32 floating-point IEEE 32-bit-float range 
double 64 floating-point IEEE 64-bit-float range 
 

These primitive data types are very common in binary-data encoding and reflect what modern 
computers use internally.  The signed integers all use 2’s-complement encoding for negative 
numbers and the floating-point numbers use IEEE-754 representation [IEEE]. 

Arguably, unsigned versions of 32 and 64-bit integers could also be useful, but their marginal 
utility in this environment is not considered to be significant enough to justify the additional 
complexity they would impose on BXML readers.  Also, in instances where a larger number

19 

type must be used, such as using a 64-bit long to represent an unsigned 32-bit value such as 
3000000000, the ‘unused’ bits in the larger integer will be highly compressible.  An 
unsigned version of the 16-bit integer, ushort, is provided since this type is commonly used 
for sample/observation values in scientific and imagery data, (along with byte, short, and 
float). 

In many places, the type of data that is present must be identified.   This is accomplished by 
preceding the value with a single-byte code defined as follows: 

byte enum ValueType {     // value-type identifier codes 
    BoolCode    = 0xF0,   // boolean value 
    ByteCode    = 0xF1,   // 'byte' numeric value 
    ShortCode   = 0xF2,   // 'short' numeric value 
    UShortCode  = 0xF3,   // 'ushort' numeric type 
    IntCode     = 0xF4,   // 'int' numeric value 
    LongCode    = 0xF6,   // 'long' numeric value 
    FloatCode   = 0xF8,   // 'float' numeric value 
    DoubleCode  = 0xF9,   // 'double' numeric value 
    StringCode  = 0xFA,   // character string 
    ArrayCode   = 0xFB,   // string of scalar values 
} 

Value-type code values 0xF5, 0xF7, and 0xFC to 0xFF are reserved for future expansion.  
Codes from 0x00 to 0xEF are reserved for use with the SmallNum type defined below. 

A Boolean type is defined as being a single byte as follows: 

byte enum Bool {                  // raw boolean value 
    FALSE = 0x00, 
    TRUE  = 0x01 
} 

In cases where the type must be identified (in user data), the following structure is used: 

BoolValue {                      // type-identified boolean value 
    ValueType type = BoolCode;   // value-type identifier code 
    Bool      bool;              // literal value 
} 

In cases where the type must be identified for integer types, the following definitions are 
used: 

ByteNum {                        // 8-bit unsigned integer value 
    ValueType type = ByteCode;   // value-type identifier code 
    byte      num;               // number 
} 

ShortNum {                       // 16-bit integer value 
    ValueType type = ShortCode;  // value-type identifier code 



03-002r9

20 

    short     num;               // number 
} 

UShortNum {                      // 16-bit unsigned integer value 
    ValueType type = UShortCode; // value-type identifier code 
    ushort    num;               // number 
} 

IntNum {                         // 32-bit integer value 
    ValueType type = IntCode;    // value-type identifier code 
    int       num;               // number 
} 

LongNum {                        // 64-bit integer value 
    ValueType type = LongCode;   // value-type identifier code 
    long      num;               // number 
} 

Since the numbers that will be used in general most frequently will be small numbers, the 
following type is defined: 

SmallNum {                       // compact, limited-range int 
    byte      num;               // number: only values 0 to 239 
} 

Only values from 0 to 239 (0x00 to 0xEF) are allowed to be used and these values double as 
the value-type-identification code relative to the ValueType enumeration: codes 0x00 to 
0xEF identify the SmallNum type.  This allows type-identified small numbers to have a 
compact, single-byte, literal representation. 

The Count type is used to represent object counts, lengths, sizes, and file offsets in many 
places.  It is defined as: 

union Count {   // numeric value type for counts, offsets 
    SmallNum,   // negative numbers are invalid 
    UShortNum, 
    IntNum, 
    LongNum 
} 

Eight exabytes ought to be enough for anybody.  This definition comprises various type-
identified integer types to allow a compact representation of count values.  The type used is 
identified by the first byte, and small numbers will only require a single byte.  However, there 
is no requirement that the minimal-space sub-type be used.  The ByteNum type was excluded 
from this definition to simplify readers, since it does not add sufficient compactness beyond 
the SmallNum type to justify its use.  Negative numbers are not valid to be used with this 
type. 

Type-identified versions of the floating-point numeric types are defined as follows: 



03-002r9 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved.  
 

21 

FloatNum {                       // single-precision floating point 
    ValueType type = FloatCode;  // value-type identifier code 
    float     num;               // number 
} 

DoubleNum {                      // double-precision floating point 
    ValueType type = DoubleCode; // value-type identifier code 
    double    num;               // number 
} 

Character strings are represented in BXML as follows: 

String {                      // raw character string 
    Count  byteLength;        // length in bytes 
    byte   chars[byteLength]; // characters in proper encoding 
} 

The byte length is given up front so that the data may be efficiently processed as a block.  
The length gives the raw number of bytes used by the string, which is not necessarily equal to 
the number of characters present.  The characters are represented using the character-set-
encoding definition that is supplied in the BXML file header.  No termination character is 
required to be present in the string, but any new-line characters or sequences, such as CR-LF 
(#xD #xA), must be normalized to a single line-feed (#xA) character.  This normalization is 
defined in the XML 1.0 specification for use with all XML processors, and adding the 
requirement to all BXML writers allows readers to be more efficient. 

The type-identified version of the string type is: 

StringValue {                     // type-identified string value 
    ValueType type = StringCode;  // value-type identifier code 
    String    string;             // string value 
} 

Arrays of values are allowed for user content.  The Array type is defined as: 

Array {                             // array of numbers/strings 
    ValueType    type = ArrayCode;  // type id for this object 
    ValueType    elementType;       // type of elements 
    Count        length;            // length of array 
    ArrayElement elements[length];  // elements of array 
} 

union ArrayElement {   // types allowed as an array element 
    Bool, 
    byte, short, ushort, int, long, float, double 
} 

The String type has been intentionally left out of the ArrayElement definition because 
arrays of strings are infrequently used in practice and the inclusion of this type would

22 

unnecessarily complicate BXML processors, since strings are significantly structurally 
different from numbers and booleans.  The elementType is given in the Array structure so 
that raw primitive types may be used for the elements instead type-identified values.  This 
saves one byte per element but also allows the array contents to be processed as a single 
block.  In some programming languages, such as C/C++, a numeric file array can even be 
directly read into or written out of an array as used in the language, for exceptional 
efficiency.  The array-encoding structure also combines nicely with the XML-Schema 
[XMLSCHEMA] “list” type for representing XML content. 

The Value type encodes generic, type-identified user data and is defined as follows: 

union Value {      // union of all user-data 'value' types 
    BoolValue, 
    SmallNum, 
    ByteNum, ShortNum, UShortNum, IntNum, LongNum, 
    FloatNum, DoubleNum, 
    StringValue, 
    Array 
} 

8.2 File structure 

A BXML file is encoded simply as a fixed-format header followed by any number of token 
objects: 

BXMLFile {             // BXML file format 
    Header  header;    // file header 
    Token   tokens[];  // sequence of tokens 
} 

The last token must be a special TrailerToken, which is defined in Clause 8.11. 

8.3 Header 

The file header is used to identify the type of the file and provide the critical information 
necessary for a reader to process the file.  It has the following structure: 

Header { 
    Identifier  identifier;          // file-format identifier 
    Version     version;             // BXML version number 
    byte        flags1;              // header bit flags 
    byte        flags2;              // more header bit flags 
    Compression compression;         // file-body compression 
    String      charEncoding;        // character encoding used 
} 

The identifier portion of the header identifies the file as being of the BXML type and is 
defined as: 



03-002r9 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved.  
 

23 

Identifier {                                    // format identifier 
    byte  nonText = 0x01;                       // ascii SOH 
    byte  name[5] = { 'B', 'X', 'M', 'L', 0x00 }; 
    byte  binaryCheck[3] = { 0xFF, 0x0D, 0x0A }; // high-bit, CR+LF 
} 

Many systems check the identification portion or “magic number” of a file to determine or 
verify its type.  The design here was inspired by the PNG image-format [PNG] identification 
section.  The first byte is used to help insure that the file is not mistaken for a text file.  The 
apropos ASCII SOH or “Start of Header” character code is used for this purpose.  The next 
five bytes identify the file type with a human-readable string.  The trailing zero is used to 
help prevent name conflicts with other potential formats (in the event that a different file 
format had “BXML” as a prefix of its full name).  Finally, the binaryCheck field helps to 
insure the early detection of a file that has been mangled by being improperly processed and 
translated in a text or a 7-bit file mode.  This check is especially important with BXML since 
it will likely be used in conjunction with the plain-text XML format. 

The version of the BXML file is identified using three sequential bytes in the following 
structure: 

Version {             // version of BXML (not XML) 
    byte  major = 0;  // x.y.z (0-255 for each component) 
    byte  minor = 0; 
    byte  point = 8; 
} 

This identifies the version of the BXML file format and not the version of the XML content 
(which is identified in the XmlDeclarationToken).  The BXML version for this 
experimental stage is “0.0.8”.  The values are coded simply as raw bytes.  A BXML reader 
must reject any file with a version that it does not specifically support, since the BXML 
structures and semantics may change arbitrarily between versions.  In fact, even the header 
format can change arbitrarily between versions, so only the identifier and version 
fields of the header should be checked to determine compatibility.  No specific mechanism is 
included in this specification to help a writer to select a version that a reader is known to 
support. 

The flags1 and flags2 fields encode various control-information bit flags for the BXML 
file.  The bits of the flags1 field have the following meanings: 

Name Bit Pattern True / 1 False / 0 
isLittleEndian 0 0x01 little endian big endian 
charsAreLittleEndian 1 0x02 little endian big endian 
hasRandomAccessInfo 2 0x04 random access not random access 
hasStrictXmlStrings 3 0x08 strings are strict strings are unrestricted 
isValidated 4 0x10 XML is validated XML is not validated 
 



03-002r9 

 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved. 
 
24 

Bit positions 5 (0x20), 6 (0x40) and 7 (0x80) of flags1 are presently unused and must be 
assigned the value of zero.  The flags2 field is presently completely unused and all bits 
must be set to zeros. 

The isLittleEndian bit flag is used to specify the endian (byte order) that is used for all 
multi-byte binary numbers throughout the file except for multi-byte character values.  A 
value of 1 means that little endian is used (least-significant byte first) and a value of 0 means 
that big endian is used (most-significant byte first). 

The charsAreLittleEndian bit flag indicates the ‘default’ byte order for multi-byte 
character codes, such as UTF-16.  A value of 1 means that little endian is used and 0 means 
big endian.  Some character encoding schemes may have internal byte-order specifications 
that override this default value, and others such as ISO-8859-1 do not require a byte order, in 
which case this value may be ignored. 

The hasRandomAccessInfo bit flag indicates whether the requisite information is available 
for a reader to process the file (or the uncompressed version of the file) in a random-access 
fashion.  A value of 1 indicates that at least the string-table index is set up in the 
TrailerToken, which is defined in Clause 8.11.  A value of 0 indicates that random-access 
information is unavailable. 

The hasStrictXmlStrings bit flag indicates whether all strings which contain content or 
comments contain strictly what textual XML allows them to contain (value of 1) or whether 
they may contain any and all characters and sequences (value of 0).  This issue is discussed 
in Clause 7.5. 

The isValidated bit flag indicates whether or not the XML content of the document has 
been positively validated to be syntactically correct relative to the XML-Schema or other 
definition of its format.  This flag can be used as an optimization to avoid validating the 
document more than once. 

The compression type is specified in the header using the following code values: 

byte enum Compression {    // compression code value 
    NoCompression = 0x00,  // no compression is used 
    GZIP          = 0x01   // everything after header is GZIP stream 
} 

In the case of NoCompression, the sequence of tokens that constitute the body of the 
document shall be encoded literally as is specified in the following sections.  In the case of 
GZIP compression, the content shall be encoded as a complete GZIP-compressed [GZIP] 
byte stream of the tokens, starting at the first byte after the file header.  If file offsets are 
specified within the compressed body, the file offsets shall refer to the file positions that 
would be used in an uncompressed file.  If a compressed file is to be used for random access, 
it will need to be uncompressed first.

25 

The charEncoding field of the header identifies the character-set encoding that is used for 
all of the Strings in the file with the exception of this string itself.  This string is encoded in 
US-ASCII format.  This string also supplies the value for the implied encoding attribute of 
the equivalent structure to the XML “<?xml…?>” construct, XmlDeclarationToken.  A 
typical value for this string will be “UTF-8”.  Note that the inclusion of a String field 
makes the file header variable-sized. 

8.4 Tokens 

Tokens are used to encode the content of the BXML file in discrete “packets” that correspond 
roughly to XML markups.  The type-identification codes for the various token types are as 
follows: 

byte enum TokenType {               //  token-type code value 
    EmptyElementCode       = 0x00,  //  <element/> 
    EmptyAttrElementCode   = 0x01,  //  <element .../> 
    ContentElementCode     = 0x02,  //  <element> ... 
    ContentAttrElementCode = 0x03,  //  <element ...> ... 
    ElementEndCode         = 0x04,  //  </element> 
    AttributeStartCode     = 0x05,  //  attr=" 
    AttributeListEndCode   = 0x06,  //  end of attributes 
    CharContentCode        = 0x10,  //  character content 
    CharContentRefCode     = 0x11,  //  string-table char content 
    CDataSectionCode       = 0x12,  //  <![CDATA[content]]> 
    WhitespaceCode         = 0x13,  //  whitespace character content 
    BlobSectionCode        = 0x14,  //  raw-binary data 
    EntityRefCode          = 0x15,  //  &entity_ref; 
    CharEntityRefCode      = 0x16,  //  &#char_ref; 
    CommentCode            = 0x17,  //  <!--comment--> 
    XmlDeclarationCode     = 0x20,  //  <?xml ...?> 
    BangCode               = 0x21,  //  <!name ...> 
    BangBracketCode        = 0x22,  //  <![name[...]]> 
    ProcessingInstrCode    = 0x23,  //  <?name ...?> 
    StringTableCode        = 0x30,  //  string table (fragment) 
    IndexTableCode         = 0x31,  //  index table 
    TrailerCode            = 0x32   //  trailer 
} 

The numeric-code values are separated into groups so that any code values added in the 
future may appear close to the other members of their logical group. 

The union of all of the tokens (referenced in the file-format definition) is: 

union Token {    // union of all tokens 
    EmptyElementToken, EmptyAttrElementToken, ContentElementToken, 
    ContentAttrElementToken, ElementEndToken, AttributeStartToken, 
    AttributeListEndToken, CharContentToken, CharContentRefToken, 
    CDataSectionToken, WhitespaceToken, BlobSectionToken, 
    EntityRefToken, CharEntityRefToken, CommentToken, 



03-002r9

26 

    XmlDeclarationToken, BangToken, BangBracketToken, 
    ProcessingInstrToken, StringTableToken, IndexTableToken, 
    TrailerToken 
} 

8.5 Elements and attributes 

Elements and attribute definitions are split into the pieces that normally represent nodes in a 
tree representation of an XML document.  The element and attribute definitions are modelled 
after the WAP-XML representation.  An element starts with one of: EmptyElementToken, 
EmptyAttrElementToken, ContentElementToken, or ContentAttrElementToken.  
The type of token identifies whether there are attributes or content present within the element.  
The least-significant two bits of the code value can be used to identify whether the content 
and/or attributes are present. 

8.5.1 Empty-element token 

The empty-element (with no attributes) token is defined as: 

EmptyElementToken {              // <element/> 
    TokenType  type = EmptyElementCode; // token-type code 
    Count      stringRef;        // symbol code for element name 
} 

This token is equivalent to the XML empty-element markup, e.g., “<blah/>” (without 
quotations).  This token is self-complete and does not need to be followed by any other 
specific tokens.  A symbol-string reference is used instead of a literal element name for space 
and processing efficiency.  The string reference is an index into the global string table, where 
index values start from zero.  Element-name values must conform to XML constraints. 

8.5.2 Empty-element-with-attributes token 

The empty-element-with-attributes token is defined as: 

EmptyAttrElementToken {          // <element ... /> 
    TokenType  type = EmptyAttrElementCode; // token-type code 
    Count      stringRef;        // symbol code for element name 
} 

This token is equivalent to the XML empty-element markup, e.g., “<blah 
attr="value"/>”.  This token must be followed by a list of at least one 
AttributeStartToken plus associated content, and the attribute list must be terminated by 
an AttributeListEndToken, or, optionally, a StringTableToken may precede any 
AttributeStartToken, to simplify string-table handling in writers. 

8.5.3 Content-element token 

The content-element (without attributes) token is defined as: 



03-002r9 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved.  
 

27 

ContentElementToken {            // <element> 
    TokenType  type = ContentElementCode; // token-type code 
    Count      stringRef;        // symbol code for element name 
} 

This token may be followed by any number of content tokens and embedded sub-elements, 
including zero, and must be terminated by an ElementEndToken. 

8.5.4 Content-element-with-attributes token 

The content-element-with-attributes token is defined as: 

ContentAttrElementToken {        // <element ...> 
    TokenType  type = ContentAttrElementCode; // token-type code 
    Count      stringRef;        // symbol code for element name 
} 

This token must be followed by a list of at least one AttributeStartToken plus 
associated content (with optional StringTableToken prefixes), and the attribute list must 
be terminated by an AttributeListEndToken.  The attribute list may be followed by any 
number of content tokens and embedded sub-elements, including zero, and the token 
sequence must be terminated by an ElementEndToken. 

8.5.5 Element-end token 

The element-end token is defined as: 

ElementEndToken {                      // </element> 
    TokenType  type = ElementEndCode;  // token-type code 
} 

This token is equivalent to the XML element-closing markup, e.g., “</blah>” and is used to 
terminate only element-token types that explicitly include content, i.e., 
ContentElementToken and ContentAttrElementToken. 

The element-name equivalent is omitted since it is redundant in textual XML and it is not 
useful in a binary environment, since humans are unlikely to edit binary XML by hand.  
WAP-XML also omits the element name in its equivalent construct. 

8.5.6 Attribute-start token  

The attribute-start token is used to define an attribute and defined as: 

AttributeStartToken {       // attr=" 
    TokenType  type = AttributeStartCode; // token-type code 
    Count      stringRef;   // symbol code for attribute name 
} 



03-002r9

28 

This token is equivalent to the starting portion of the XML attribute-definition markup, e.g., 
“attr="”.  The attribute name is referenced from the global string table for efficiency.  This 
token must be followed by some number of content tokens, including zero, that define the 
attribute value.  If the strictXmlStrings header flag is set, then this token is interpreted 
to enclose the content in the double-quotation character (") and the attribute content therefore 
must not include this character literally (an entity reference must be used instead).  If the 
header flag is not set, then character content may include any literal characters.  If textual 
XML is regenerated from the attribute content with a non-strict string, the translator will need 
to select a quotation character to use to embed the content (the double-quotation mark is 
suggested) and it will need to escape any instances of that character in the attribute content 
using “&quot;” or “&apos;” as appropriate. 

The attribute-value-definition content tokens must be followed by either another 
AttributeStartToken to continue the attribute list or an AttributeListEndToken to 
terminate the attribute list of an element.  However, as noted elsewhere, any 
AttributeStartToken may be directly preceded by a StringTableToken, to simplify 
writers. 

8.5.7 Attribute-list-end token 

The attribute-list-end token is used to terminate the attribute list of an element and is defined 
as: 

AttributeListEndToken {              // end marker of attribute list 
    TokenType  type = AttributeListEndCode;  // token-type code 
} 

8.6 Content Representation 

Several token types are used to represent various types of literal XML content.  A content 
segment of XML may be represented by any sequence and combination of these content 
tokens.  The validity of a sequence of content tokens within a BXML file is defined as the 
validity of the textual equivalent to the tokens as it would appear in textual XML relative to 
the content-type definition in XML-Schema or other definition languages. 

It is recognized that the ideal processing environment for BXML is one in which binary 
content is passed directly from generator to parser to application without ever being 
translated into text in between.  Therefore, it is recommended that the XML parser scan and 
store equivalent structures to the content tokens defined in this section and that it avoid 
translating numbers and “blobs” into a textual equivalent if at all possible in passing the 
content information to the reading application. 

8.6.1 Character content token 

The token that corresponds to regular textual XML content is defined as: 



03-002r9 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved.  
 

29 

CharContentToken {                     // regular character content 
    TokenType type = CharContentCode;  // token-type code 
    Value     content;                 // single content value 
} 

The content field can include any Value sub-type, including numbers and arrays.  These 
special types are considered to be equivalent to the character representation for the purpose of 
XML validation.  If the strictXmlStrings flag in the header is set, then the content must 
conform to textual XML constraints, which means that the literal characters “<” and “&” must 
not appear in the string and the sequence “]]>” must have its final “>” character changed.  
These characters must be generated using entity references.  Otherwise, if the flag is not set, 
then the content may include any and all literal characters.  Leading and trailing whitespace 
characters that are included in a string may be considered to be significant by a reader. 

However, the representation of numbers and especially arrays of numbers can be much more 
efficient than the equivalent text, and it also can be processed much more efficiently if the 
parser and the application are capable of carrying the raw numeric representation through the 
parsing and interpretation process. 

The representation of numeric values used in content is independent of the DTD/XML-
Schema/RDF-Schema that defines a format.  The most efficient or convenient representation 
of a numeric value may be chosen by the writer.  For instance, if XML Schema defines the 
content to be a list of double numbers, an array of float values may be used instead for 
greater efficiency if the data will be adequately represented as floats.  The content could 
also be provided as a character String, an array of bytes (if sufficient), or as being spread 
out over multiple content tokens. 

8.6.2 Character-string-reference content token 

The character-string-reference content token is defined as: 

CharContentRefToken {                     // character content 
    TokenType type = CharContentRefCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     stringRef;                  // string-table ref 
} 

This token is equivalent to the CharContentToken, except that instead of using content that 
is stored in-line, it refers a string that is stored in the global string table.  This offers greater 
compactness than the CharContentToken for representing content strings that are repeated 
very frequently in a document (by consuming as little as two bytes per use regardless of the 
string length). 

8.6.3 CDATA content token 

The CDATA content token is defined as: 



03-002r9 

 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved. 
 
30 

CDataSectionToken {                     // <![CDATA[content]]> 
    TokenType type = CDataSectionCode;  // token-type code 
    Value     content;                  // single content value 
} 

This is equivalent to the “<![CDATA[content]]>” structure in textual XML.  This token is 
essentially equivalent to the CharContentToken, except that its use may be regarded as a 
hint to a translator to regenerate a CDATA section in textual XML.  If the 
strictXmlStrings header flag is set, then the content string must not include the character 
sequence “]]>”.  If this header flag is not set, then the content may include the sequence.  
However, since XML CDATA sections must not include the character sequence “]]>”, it may 
not be possible to regenerate a valid CDATA section in textual XML in all cases.  If it is not, 
then regular character content must be regenerated with appropriate escape sequences.  A 
CDATA section is normally used in XML to represent strings with literal “<”, “>”, or “&” 
characters, where these characters are used literally for the purposes of visual appearance or 
convenience. 

8.6.4 Whitespace content token 

The token that encodes potentially insignificant whitespace is defined as: 

WhitespaceToken {               // possibly insignificant whitespace 
    TokenType type = WhitespaceCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     nBlankLines;            // number of blank lines 
    String    content;                // literal whitespace content 
} 

Whitespace is defined in XML as strings of the Unicode characters #x20, #x9, #xD, and 
#xA.  The XML specification defines that all whitespace in an XML document is significant 
and must be passed to the reading application.  However, in practice with most applications,  
much of the whitespace included for formatting and visual presentation of a textual XML 
document is actually insignificant.  Usage of the WhitespaceToken allows BXML readers 
to remove insignificant whitespace efficiently.  The writer is not required to use this token, 
but whitespace that is included in other content tags may be considered to be significant by 
the reader.  A textual-XML translator may also wish to remove potentially insignificant 
whitespace from a stream anyway, except maybe for completely blank lines. 

“Potentially insignificant whitespace” is defined as all sequences of exclusively whitespace 
characters that separate markup items in textual XML.  This includes life-feeds (#xA 
character) and indentation characters that are normally inserted before element opening and 
closing tags. 

The nBlankLines field records the number of completely blank lines that are included 
within the whitespace token.  These are normally inserted into an XML file for visual 
separation between file structures and can make a file much more readable and essentially 
can be considered to be comments.  The number of completely blank lines can be counted as 
being one less than the number of newline characters in the whitespace string.  This 



03-002r9

31 

information can be useful to record and reproduce blank lines without any extraneous other 
whitespace characters when generating textual XML from BXML. 

8.6.5 Blob content token 

A “blob” is an opaque block of raw binary user data.  The blob content token is defined as: 

BlobSectionToken {                 // raw-binary blob 
    TokenType    type = BlobSectionCode; // token-type code 
    TextBlobType textEncoding;     // encoding to use in text XML 
    Count        length;           // length in bytes 
    byte         content[length];  // raw bytes of blob 
} 

byte enum TextBlobType {  // equivalent text-encoding code 
    None      = 0x00,     // there is no text-encoded equivalent 
    HexCoded  = 0x01,     // text would use hexadecimal encoding 
    Base64    = 0x02,     // text would use base-64 encoding 
    ByteArray = 0x03      // text would use number array 
} 

Binary user data cannot be represented directly in textual XML, which is a major limitation 
and source of headaches, but it can be in BXML.  Binary data can either be referenced 
indirectly with URIs or it can be stored in-line in a text encoding in textual XML.  Base-64 
encoding [BASE64] is frequently used for this purpose. 

It is important to be able to translate a blob into a textual-XML representation if that should 
become necessary, so the textEncoding field is provided to indicate what textual 
representation to use when translating.  An encoding value of None means that no text-
encoding equivalent is available and a translator must report an error if the attempt is made. 

Normally, an application writing a blob will write it directly into a BXML file, but it is 
possible for a general translator to detect blobs in some textual XML files.  XML Schema 
includes definitions of the intrinsic types “hexBinary” and “Base64Binary” which 
correspond to the HexCoded and Base64 code values above in the TextBlobType.  A 
validating translator could read in the text-encoded blob from an XML file and emit a 
BlobSectionToken into the BXML file. 

8.6.6 Entity-reference token 

The entity-reference token is defined as: 

EntityRefToken {                    // &entity; 
    TokenType type = EntityRefCode; // token-type code 
    Count     stringRef;            // name reference 
} 



03-002r9

32 

This is equivalent to the XML “&name;” construct to reference an environmentally-defined 
entity object.  A string-table reference is used to identify the entity name, as with attribute 
and element names.  The entity references of “&amp;”, “&lt;”, “&gt;” , “&quot;”, and 
“&apos;” are normally used as character-escape sequences in textual XML, but it is 
suggested that the characters that these entities represent be used literally in BXML content, 
for efficiency and convenience. 

8.6.7 Character-entity-reference token 

The character-entity-reference token is defined as: 

CharEntityRefToken {                    // &#char_code; 
    TokenType type = CharEntityRefCode; // token-type code 
    Count     unicodeChar;              // unicode character number 
} 

This is equivalent to the XML “&#char_code;” Unicode-character-code entity reference. 

8.7 Comment token 

The comment token is defined as: 

CommentToken {                     // <!--comment--> 
    TokenType type = CommentCode;  // token-type code 
    PosHint   positioningHint;     // comment positioning 
    String    content;             // content of comment 
} 

byte enum PosHint { 
    PosIndented    = 0x00,  // on fresh line but indented 
    PosStartOfLine = 0x01,  // at start of fresh line 
    PosEndOfLine   = 0x02   // after previous content 
} 

This is equivalent to the XML “<!--comment-->” comment construct and it is provided so 
that comments can be retained in a BXML file to better mirror the XML content.  If the 
strictXmlStrings header flag is set, then the content string must not include the 
character sequence “--” (two hyphens).  If the header flag is not set, then the content may 
include this sequence, but if it does, then the sequence must be substituted with something 
else if this comment is generated into textual XML, perhaps “-=”.  This case is not 
considered a breach of translating “with no loss of information” since the object in question is 
only a comment and it could not have originated from a textual-XML document. 

The whitespace that is included in the content string may be considered to be significant by 
an application, including leading and trailing whitespace.  If there is no leading or trailing 
whitespace in a string, a textual-XML writer may choose to insert a single space after and 
before the “<!--” and “-->” sequences.

33 

The positioningHint field is provided to give a hint of what line position in textual XML 
a comment should be regenerated.  Comments will normally be indented on a fresh line, but 
options are provided to suggest that they be generated at the start of a fresh line in case the 
comment has full-width visual formatting, or at the end of the previous content/markup 
object, in the case that the comment describes that object. 

8.8 XML control tokens 

8.8.1 XML-declaration token 

The XML-declaration token is defined as follows: 

XmlDeclarationToken {           // <?xml ...?> 
    TokenType type = XmlDeclarationCode;  // token-type code 
    String    version;          // XML version 
    Bool      standalone;       // document is standalone 
    Bool      standaloneIsSet;  // "standalone" is used 
} 

This is equivalent to the “<?xml …?>” XML-declaration construct (where the substring 
“xml” is case-insensitive) and it should normally be the first token present in the BXML 
token stream.  The semantics for the version and standalone fields are the same as for 
the attributes of the same names for the XML-declaration.  The version field may be 
logically marked as not being present for the XML semantics by assigning them a zero-length 
string, and the logical presence of the standalone field is indicated by the 
standaloneIsSet field.  No character-set “encoding” value is given here, but the value 
implied for that attribute of the XML declaration is the charEncoding value from the 
Header structure. 

8.8.2 Bang token 

The “bang” token is defined as: 

BangToken {                     // <!name ...>, e.g., DOCTYPE 
    TokenType type = BangCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     nameRef;          // name of tag, string-table ref 
    String    content;          // verbatim character content 
} 

This is equivalent to the XML construct of the form “<!name …>”.  “Bang” is a synonym 
used sometimes for the exclamation mark (!).  This construct is infrequently used in practice.  
The name is given by a string-table reference and the content is represented simply as a 
verbatim unparsed string.  The name and content have the same semantics and restrictions as 
in textual XML.  An example name is “DOCTYPE” and this type has a complex structure that 
is not worth tokenizing in the BXML file since non-validating parsers/generators likely will 
not understand it, and the parsers that do will most likely also support the textual XML 



03-002r9 

 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved. 
 
34 

format and will therefore be able to handle the unparsed string anyway.  “ENTITY” 
declarations also use this token, among others. 

8.8.3 Bang-bracket token 

The bang-bracket token is defined as: 

BangBracketToken {                     // <![name[...]]>, not CDATA 
    TokenType type = BangBracketCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     nameRef;                 // name of tag, string ref 
    String    content;                 // verbatim character content 
} 

This token is equivalent to the XML construct “<![name[…]]>”, except that the 
CDataSectionToken is used instead for the name being “CDATA”.  This type of markup is 
used in XML conditional sections which are rarely used in practice.  The name is given by a 
reference into the global string table and the content is an unparsed verbatim string and 
these values have the same semantics and restrictions as in textual XML. 

8.8.4 Processing-instruction token 

The processing-instruction token is defined as: 

ProcessingInstrToken {             // <?name ...?> excl. "<?xml?>" 
    TokenType type = ProcessingInstrCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     nameRef;             // name of tag, string-table ref 
    String    content;             // verbatim content, or "" 
} 

This is used to represent XML constructs of the form “<?name …?>”, excluding the XML-
declaration construct.  Processing instructions are rarely used in practice.  The name is given 
as a reference into the global string table and the content is an unparsed verbatim string and 
these values have the same semantics and restrictions as in textual XML. 

8.9 String table 

The string-table-fragment structure is defined as: 

StringTableToken {                     // string table (fragment) 
    TokenType type = StringTableCode;  // token-type code 
    Count     nStrings;                // number of strings in frag. 
    String    strings[nStrings];       // string values 
} 

The global string table may be split into many string-table fragments.  This is to make it more 
convenient to implement a sequential writer by not requiring that it know every symbol/string 
it might produce in advance.  This may also allow the global string table to be more compact, 
since only a small subset of available symbols/strings may be used in any particular XML 



03-002r9 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved.  
 

35 

document, and it may not be practical to pre-compute this limited subset of symbols before 
emitting the first XML tag.  The writer has the choice of emitting all strings up-front, or in 
batches as different portions of the generator program are executed, or individually on an as-
used basis (though this approach may be inefficient in terms of space and parsing time). 

Some constraints are placed on the logical global string table.  All string-table fragments 
define global string/symbol codes sequentially starting from zero, and any literal string must 
appear in the global string table only once, even if it is used in different contexts (e.g., as an 
element name and as an attribute name).  Also, each symbol string must be defined in the 
BXML stream before it is first referenced when the token stream is read sequentially; 
however, there is no requirement that a particular string ever actually be referenced.  The 
strings when used as element/attribute symbol names are subject to the constraints on names 
in textual XML. 

The string-table index in the TrailerToken may be used to reassemble the global string 
table for use during random access, or to access only selected string definitions on an as-
needed basis. 

8.10 Index table 

The index-table structure is defined as: 

IndexTableToken {                       // index table 
    TokenType    type = IndexTableCode; // token-type code 
    Count        skipSize;              // size of rest of token 
    String       xpathExpr;             // XPath expression 
    Count        nEntries;              // number of index entries 
    IndexTableEntry entries[nEntries];  // index-table entries 
} 

IndexTableEntry {                      // index value-match entry 
    Value          value;              // match value 
    Count          nOffsets;           // number of matching offsets 
    Count          offsets[nOffsets];  // offsets to match elements 
} 

An index table is used to provide a simple mechanism to use to randomly access elements in 
the token stream that have properties of certain values.  The xpathExpr value defines the 
property to be tested using an XPath expression [XPATH], and the entries give match 
values (equality comparison) for the test property and file offsets to the start of the element 
tokens that include the referenced property.  The skipSize is provided to allow a reader to 
easily skip over the index table if it is not interested in using the index. 

Any number of index tables may be provided within a BXML file, but the XPath expression 
must be unique for each.  Index tables will normally be placed at the end of the BXML 
stream, since this will be the point that the writer will have collected all of the necessary 



03-002r9 

 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium. All Rights Reserved. 
 
36 

information.  There is no obligation for a writer to generate any index tables at all, but a 
processing system may add them later (to the end of the stream) if it wishes. 

8.11 Trailer Token 

The trailer token is defined as: 

TrailerToken {                     // last token of every file 
    TokenType        tokenType = TrailerCode; // token-type code 
    byte             id[4] = { 0x01, 'T', 'R', 0x00 }; // id 
    StringTableIndex stringIndex;  // index of string tables 
    IndexTableIndex  indexIndex;   // index of index-tables 
    int              tokenLength;  // length of this token 
} 

This token marks the end of the BXML file for the reader and also provides a collected set of 
string-table references that logically constitutes a global string table and a collected set of 
index-table references.  The four-byte tokenLength records the complete length of the 
TrailerToken and is required to be the fixed-size last field so that the start of the 
TrailerToken may be located to facilitate random access by reading the last four bytes of 
the BXML file.  (Consequently, the TrailerToken is restricted to being at most 
approximately 2GB in size.)  This token is required to be present at the end of every BXML 
file, even if the StringTableIndex and IndexTableIndex are marked as being ‘unused’. 

The id field serves a similar purpose to the identifier field of the Header structure at the 
beginning of the BXML file.  It is included in the trailer token to help assure the detection of 
a truncated BXML file.  If the BXML file is truncated, then random access will not work, and 
the file can probably be discarded as a whole.  To check for truncation, the reader must first 
access the tokenLength field to locate the start of the TrailerToken, and then check that 
the tokenType and id fields have the correct values. 

The string-table index is defined as: 

StringTableIndex {           // index of string-table fragments 
    Bool    isUsed;          // flag for whether this is active 
    Count   nFragments;      // number of fragments in index 
    StringTableIndexEntry fragments[nFragments];  // string tables 
} 

StringTableIndexEntry {      // string-table index fragment 
    Count  nStringsDefined;  // number of strings defined in frag. 
    Count  fileOffset;       // file offset to string-table token 
} 

This gives an index for all of the string-table fragments by storing the file offset to each 
fragment token that is present in the file.  However, its use is optional, and it need not be 
given by setting the isUsed flag to FALSE and nFragments to zero.  In this case, the 
hasRandomAccessInfo in the header must be set to FALSE. 



03-002r9

37 

The index-table index is defined as: 

IndexTableIndex {            // index of index tables 
    byte    isUsed;          // flag for whether this is active 
    Count   nEntries;        // number of index-tables 
    IndexTableIndexEntry entries[nEntries]; // index-table indexes 
} 

IndexTableIndexEntry {        // entry for index 
    String       xpathExpr;   // XPath expression that is indexed 
    Count        fileOffset;  // file offset of index-table token 
} 

This gives an index of all index tables present in the file.  If no information is available, 
isUsed must be set to FALSE and nEntries to zero. 

9 Interoperability 

9.1 MIME & file types 

When used in a MIME type, the BXML format should be identified by substituting the 
substring "xml" which normally identifies textual XML format with “x-bxml”.  For 
example, the type “text/xml” would be “text/x-bxml” for BXML, and 
“application/vnd.ogc.wms+xml” would be “application/vnd.ogc.wms+x-bxml”. 

Since “BXML” is a four-letter acronym, it faces the same problem as HTML when it comes 
to filename extensions, as different systems and people use either a three-letter or four-letter 
version.  The shorter name is more compact and compatible but the longer name gives more 
information.  Therefore, it is suggested that both “.BML” and “.BXML” be accepted as 
filename extensions for BXML files, using the appropriate letter case for the environment.  It 
is important to distinguish this format from textual “.XML” since they are not compatible. 

9.2 Application to GML 

It is crucially important for efficiency to encode GML coordinates as a raw binary array of 
double (or float) numbers.  For the sake of simplicity, the GML coordinate structure should 
be redefined to have the following XML-Schema type: 

<xs:simpleType name="CoordinatesType"> 
    <xs:list itemType="xs:double"/> 
</xs:simpleType> 

A list of space-separated numeric values is required for GML coordinate values to be stored 
and processed efficiently in BXML, since this is how XML Schema defines lists of numbers.  
The GML practice of allowing user-defined coordinate and point separators is really quite 
strange, especially considering that in a production environment humans rarely will ever even 
look at coordinate values and almost certainly will not edit them by hand.  Also, the user-

definable decimal-point representation is problematic since this is completely arbitrary 
relative to the definitions of numbers in XML Schema, which defines the period character to 
be the only lexical representation of a decimal point.  One is forced to speculate that the 
representations provided, especially the element-structured encoding optionally provided, is 
intended for low-volume demonstrations only and not for production work.  The element-
structured encoding, while ‘pretty’, is enormously wasteful, especially after being parsed into 
a tree structure in memory.  One might also speculate, given the arbitrary definition of the 
decimal point and given the nature of real-world implementations, that most if not all existing 
implementations of GML processors are broken. 

The standard GML practice of using a comma character as a dimensional separator is not 
compatible with the BXML numeric-array representation, but if a dimensional separator of a 
space is selected in addition to the default point separator of a space character, then the 
numeric-array encoding could actually be used, even with the current specification, assuming 
that installed parsing applications do not require the two types of separators to be different.  
However, this would be formally quite awkward to work with, and automatic detection of 
numeric lists in general by analyzing XML Schema would not be possible with GML data. 

These same issues apply to any GML observation values that may be efficiently represented 
in an array.  As an indirect example, there has been informal discussion in various forums 
about how ridiculously wasteful XML would be at representing imagery data, but with raw-
numeric arrays, a compact element type, and GZIP compression, BXML would be 
fundamentally as efficient at storing imagery data as the lossless PNG imagery format 
[PNG]. 

9.3 XML interoperability 

It is important to be able to translate back and forth to and from the textual-XML format 
without loss of information.  BXML has been designed to make this translation easy, with the 
minor exception of literal-character escaping in some cases.

Annex A: Informative - Galdos’s Report on the Binary-XML-Encoding 
Work Item 

OGC is assessing the use of binary XML encodings as a means of overcoming the 
performance and scalability problems associated with the inherent verbosity of XML data in 
the data interchange between OGC web services and their clients.  In this context, the 
proclaimed goals of the CIPI-1.1 project were: 

1. Determine the enhancements to the WFS 1.0.0 specification necessary for the 
efficient use of binary XML encodings in the data interchange between WFS and 
WFS Clients; 

2. Evaluate the usability of an existing binary XML encoding and respective 
Coder/Decoder (CODEC) API. 

Galdos believes that OGC should not tie its web services to any particular binary XML 
encoding.  Rather, the Clients should be able to negotiate with OGC web services the binary 
XML encoding of their choosing.  In accordance with this, Galdos is focusing on the two 
aforementioned goals of CIPI-1.1. 

WFS 1.0.0 Specification Enhancements 

For the WFS specification to allow for the use of binary XML encodings, the WFS has to be 
able to advertise its support for it, and WFS Clients need a way to request the data to be 
returned in binary XML.  In addition, we should allow WFS Clients to submit data encoded 
in binary XML. Below is an outline of what needs to be done to support these scenarios. 

Publishing support for binary XML encodings 

We propose that the capabilities document contain a list of supported binary XML encodings 
along with their respective MIME types (the MIME types could be used as their identifiers).  
It is assumed that both requests and responses may be encoded using those encodings. 

Similar approach can be taken for the detection of supported compression methods (e.g., 
GZIP). 

Use of binary XML encodings 

When sending a request encoded in binary XML, a WFS Client must set the content encoding 
of the data stream to the appropriate MIME type.  This will signal the encoding of the request 
to the target WFS. 

To request that the response be encoded in binary XML, a WFS Client can specify the 
desired MIME type of the response in the request.  This will necessitate adding an optional

parameter such as outputEncoding, in which Clients can specify the MIME type of their 
choosing. 

Similar approach can be taken for the use of supported compression methods (e.g., GZIP). 

Evaluation of BinXML™ Binary XML Encoding and CODEC 

Galdos has evaluated the binary XML CODEC called BinXML™.  This CODEC is being 
successfully used for video streaming, as well as for improving the efficiency of SOAP 
messaging and SVG.  [Editor’s note: BinXML™ is a proprietary product.] 

The transparency of use was deemed a key evaluation criterion, one that would largely 
determine the acceptance of a particular binary XML Decoder among WFS Client builders.  
Without a binary XML encoding, a WFS Client would access the XML data using 
standardized interfaces such as SAX and DOM.  For a binary XML CODEC to be 
transparent, it has to support these interfaces.  Simply put, it enables WFS Clients to easily 
switch between the “binary XML” and regular modes of operations.  Without transparency, 
WFS Clients would have to contain much more specialized code and thus their development 
would be far more complex.  

It should be noted that the transparency of use might not be of interest to all WFS Clients.  
There can be WFS Clients that are built with a particular binary XML encoding in mind.  
Such WFS Clients should have the option of direct access to binary-encoded data. 

Galdos’s evaluation of BinXML™ indicated that this CODEC largely satisfies these criteria.  
It supports DOM, SAX and JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) as a transparency layer on 
top of its binary XML encoding.  The BinXML™ Decoder also allows accessing the binary-
encoded XML directly without going through DOM or SAX.  Figures A-1 and A-2 illustrate 
what our view on the role of the transparency of binary XML encoding in the communication 
between WFS and Clients. 

BinXML™ also fares well in the departments of speed and compression.  The decoding time 
at the client side is much faster than for regular XML because the data is preparsed and 
prevalidated, while overhead at the encoder side is reasonable. BinXML™ is a schema-aware 
CODEC that harnesses the knowledge of the data content model carried in a XML/GML 
schema to provide optimized compression.  ZLIB compression library is used to compress 
the textual content of elements. What is very important for GML and SVG, BinXML™ 
allows customized encoding/decoding for selected elements such as gml:coordinates in 
GML.  This means that in addition to the existing compression, vendors can benefit from 
compression specifically tailored for GML/SVG applications.

Using Capabilities or 
registry query the client 
finds out that data can be 
encoded using a binary 
XML encoding. 

Client should not care how data is encoded.  
Both the client and the server may support 
a number of binary XML encodings, just 
like they can support multiple compression 
methods. If there is a binary XML encoding 
that both the client and the server support,  
data can be exchanged between them in this 
encoding.
