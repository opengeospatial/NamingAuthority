i. Abstract 
The CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, “versionable,” 
virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides for a geospatial 
content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between 
database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a 
common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can 
simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their 
respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable 
between CDB-compliant simulators.  A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation 
client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, 
etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time. 

The application of CDB to future simulation architectures will significantly reduce 
runtime-source level and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, 
update and configuration management timelines.  With the addition of the High Level 
Architecture - -Federation Object Model (HLA/FOM)1 and DIS protocols, the application 
of the CDB standard provides a Common Environment to which inter-connected 
simulators share a common view of the simulated environment. 

The CDB standard defines an open format for the storage, access and modification of a 
synthetic environment database.  A synthetic environment is a computer simulation that 
represents activities at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to 
factories and manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a 
single computer or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks 
and augmented by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE 
allows visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated2.  

This standard defines the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic 
representation of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the 
subsystems of a full-mission simulator.  The standard makes use of several commercial 
and simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. A series 
of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for data 
representation of real world features. 

The CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including 
external features such as man-made structures and systems.  A CDB data store can 
include terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-
made cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean 
bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor.  In addition, 
the data store can includes the specific attributes of the synthetic environment data as 
well as their relationships. 

The associated CDB Standard Best Practice documents provide a description of a data 
schema for Synthetic Environmental information (i.e. it merely describes data) for use in

simulation.  The CDB Standard provides a rigorous definition of the semantic meaning 
for each dataset, each attribute and establishes the structure/organization of that data as a 
schema comprised of a folder hierarchy and files with internal (industry-standard) 
formats. 

A CDB conformant data store contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-
detail. Together, these datasets represent the features of a synthetic environment for the 
purposes of distributed simulation applications.  The organization of the synthetic 
environmental data in a CDB compliant data store is specifically tailored for real-time 
applications.

iii. Preface and Patent Call 

The initial CDB specification was developed under a competitive contract awarded to 
CAE to meet requirements of the United States Special Operations Command.   
The CDB standard is widely implemented by multiple, independent industry contractors 
for end-user simulation and mission rehearsal customers in many different countries over 
a period of ten years. 

The industry-maintained CDB model and data store structure has been discussed and 
demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings beginning in September, 2013.   

At the suggestion of several attendees at the first CDB ad-hoc meeting in September, 
2014, the current version of the existing CDB standard was slightly reformatted for 
consideration as an OGC Best Practice. The OGC Best Practice is the basis of work for 
this OGC standard.

1. What is a CDB Conformant Data Store? 

A CDB3 conformant data store provides a representation of the whole earth optimized for 
very high speed access and visualization. The physical data store model divides the earth 
geographically into geodetic tiles. Each tile is defined by a latitude/longitude boundary. 
Each tile contains one or more specific sets of features.  The CDB model uses the WGS-
84 coordinate reference system (CRS). Details of the model along with implementation 
requirements are provided in Volume 1: OGC CDB Core [16-113r3]. Any simulator 
client-devices access CDB geospatial content using a WGS-84 CRS based indexing and 
tiling scheme. The physical and logical tiling system specified in the CDB standard is 
similar to an equal area implementation of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS)4. 
However, the implementation predates the OGC DGGS standards work and as such does 
not implement all the OGC DGGS requirements.  

A CDB data store contains the features and modeled representation of the synthetic 
environment.  A CDB data store can contain: 

● terrain altimetry, 
● planimetry, 
● raster imagery,  
● attribution, 
● 3D features with their modeled geometry, 
● texture and attribution.   
 

This standard also makes provision for the representation of moving models. An example 
of a moving model is a tank moving across the terrain as viewed by a helicopter pilot. 
The representation of moving models is comprehensive and goes well beyond other 
visualization standards because it makes provisions for the standardized naming 
conventions, material and feature attribution, radar/laser reflectivity, aircraft and airport 
lighting systems, armaments, special effects, collision points/volumes just to name a few. 
These provisions ensure interoperable simulation applications that are accessing a CDB 
structured data store. 

The CDB standard governs all requirements of the CDB data store, as follows: 

• Data content and representation of the synthetic environment; 
• Structure and organization of the synthetic environment; and 

                                                
3 Formerly known as Common Database the OGC Members determined that going forward that this 
standard shall be known as “CDB”.

• File format of the synthetic environment as stored on media. 
 

The CDB standard describes a modeled environment representation for distributed 
simulation applications.  Section 6.10.5 of this document, “Use of CDB in Applications 
Requiring Dynamic Synthetic Environments”, discusses how a CDB-compliant simulator 
could be adapted to handle modifications of the synthetic environment in real-time. 

Given that a CDB data store defines a structured storage structure for representation and 
attribution of terrain, geographic objects, moving objects and entities, it is possible to 
design a broad range of synthetic environment simulations that modify synthetic 
environments in real-time.  Such simulations can modify the CDB data store and then 
notify other systems in a simulation federate5 that share a CDB data store about the 
changes. This provides a synthetic environment (SE) that is persistent and fully correlated 
across all simulation federates.  For example, terrain “trafficability” could be handled by 
a new SE simulation that dynamically calculates soil moisture content as a function of 
localized rain precipitation and soil types/composition.  A second simulation would then 
derive the resulting soil physics and determine vehicle wheel slippage across the varying 
terrain conditions. 

The modification/notification approach is well-suited for a broad gamut of simulations. 
However, some simulations are very data intensive and require excessive broadcasting 
bandwidths to other federates.  In such cases, these dynamic simulations would have to 
be replicated in the other client-devices of the federation.  Good examples of this are 
visual system special effects (e.g., rotor downwash effect, missile plumes, muzzle 
flashes, cast landing lights). Typically such simulations are proprietary and intrinsic to 
the client-devices.  Other examples of this include the varying effects of weather6 (local 
winds, temperature, humidity, particulates, etc.) and oceans (currents, temperature, etc.).  

For ease of editing and review, the standard has been separated into 12 Volumes and a 
schema repository.

5 This usage of federate and federation comes from IEEE Std 1516 in the context of Federation Object 
Models (FOM) and Simulation Object Models (SOM). Common HLA terminology: Federate - an HLA 
compliant simulation entity. Federation - multiple simulation entities connected via the RTI using a 
common OMT. 
6  Time-varying weather simulation effects could be simulated by a “weather server” simulation 
subsystem which in turn can rely on the terrain elevation and terrain material datasets to perform its 
simulation of weather in real-time.

A complete glossary of Terms and Definitions used in this standard are contained in OGC 
CDB Volume 3. The following description of a synthetic environment is provided as 
context for this Primer. 

The synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment at a specific 
geographical location including the external features of the man-made structures and 
systems.  Therefore, the synthetic environment includes the terrain, the terrain features 
(both natural and manmade), three-dimensional (3D) models of vehicles, the ocean

surface, and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the 
ocean floor.  In addition, the synthetic environment includes the specific attributes of the 
synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.  The CDB Standard is more 
than just a means of creating visual (aka out-the-window) scenery.  Unlike other 
simulation industry standards that only deal with data representational types of polygons, 
colors, and textures, CDB deals with all the data types needed in high-end virtual and 
constructive simulation applications.

5. Using OGC standards with a CDB structured data store7 

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) developed the Joint Training Data Services 
(JTDS) to support rapid scenario generation for the U.S. DoD M&S training community. 
The recently developed (2014) and deployed JTDS Common Terrain Generation Service 
(C-TGS) is a cloud-based service for the war fighter. C-TGS provides a robust capability 
to search, discover and retrieve Modeling and Simulation (M&S) terrain data. JTDS 
based the CB-TGS standard data structure on OGC-approved formats served by OGC 
Web Services. The goal for the Terrain Generation Service (TGS): Eliminate the current 
paradigm where every simulation uses a different proprietary format. Current data efforts 
are fraught with simulation issues and errors, and data mining, correlation and processing 
to support multiple simulation formats is manpower intensive. 

The TGS Solution: Have a repository and user interface that provides access to a single 
source of data through a persistent web service AND set and enforce a standard data 
structure based on industry standard Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) approved 
formats, to normalize terrain data across Force Development simulations. 

                                                
7 This section is based on presentations and a paper on the JTDS CB-TGS activity. Specifically, “Cloud 
Terrain Generation and Visualization Using Open Geospatial Standards, Chambers and Freeman, 2014.

Figure: DoD C-TGS Architecture 
(Chambers and Sherman, 2014) 

 
The above figure represents the implementation architecture for CB-TGS. 
Implementation software represents a mix of commercial/proprietary and open source. At 
the heart of the C-TGS are two data stores: A CDB structured data store and a 3d model 
data store. All applications at the Visualization and Dissemination level interface the data 
stores via OGC service interfaces. 

Connecting OGC Web Services to an open, simulation-optimized terrain data store, such 
as a CDB structured data store, results in high-end performance for serving and rendering 
geospatial content, the ability to dynamically modify terrain and support for all levels of 
simulation. a high-end simulation system using CDB can dynamically update the terrain 
(such as a bomb crater) and have that dynamically updated terrain instantly served by the 
Geospatial Discovery Service to any OGC compliant system, such as Esri® ArcMap, 
QGIS, or a mobile web page. The underlying architecture and framework of the C-TGS 
provide a mechanism to move high-end simulation to the point where data sharing, 
crowd-sourcing, and dynamic terrain are in-sync with GIS tools and simulation system 
edits of the terrain repository.

6. Background and informative material 

6.1 Intended Audience 
The primary audience for the CDB standard includes distributed simulation system 
developers and synthetic environment database tool developers whose applications are 
intended to read and/or write synthetic environment database files.  To this end, this 
document discusses concepts incorporated in the standard and contains a detailed 
description of the physical layout of the files as represented on disk. 

6.2 Problem Definition 
Complex mission simulators include a wide range of subsystems designed to simulate on-
board equipment and to provide a rich gaming environment complete with weather, 
computer generated forces, ordnance, air traffic, networked players, etc.  Each of these 
subsystems traditionally utilizes a proprietary runtime database (and format) for its 
synthetic representation of the gaming area.  These application-specific formats have 
been generated off-line at a database generation facility using a variety of tools and 
processes.  This traditional approach to simulation has several inherent disadvantages, 
including length of time needed for synthetic environment production for multiple 
simulation applications, loss of correlation due to compilation differences, complexity in 
configuration management, and an inefficient update process.  The abundance of distinct 
database formats creates several challenges for configuration management, resulting in 
mismatched correlations, and in the increased timeline needed to generate these 
databases.  The CDB Standard specifies an approach that establishes conventions for all 
simulator client subsystems (aka simulator client-devices). Further, the CDB Best 
Practices provide detailed guidance on how to use a set of industry-standard formats. 

The confluence of digital multispectral high-resolution satellite imagery, real time sensor 
feeds, and highly capable visual systems has created dramatic new Mission Planning and 
Mission Rehearsal capabilities.  As a result, recent environment databases built to take 
advantage of these new capabilities require orders of magnitude more storage than 
equivalent databases just a few years ago. 

The CDB standard addresses these requirements through a common database model.  
CDB is intended as a standard for use in producing a highly performant, unified synthetic 
representation of the world.  A data store built to the CDB Standard is referred to as a 
CDB structured data store or CDB conformant data store.  A CDB structured data store is 
a single-copy data repository from which various simulator client-devices are able to 
simultaneously retrieve, in real-time, relevant information to perform their respective 
runtime simulation tasks. 

The CDB standard enhances unity and correlation between various simulator level client-
devices (e.g., Visual, Radar), while improving maintainability.  As a result, one of the 
main benefits of the CDB standard is the elimination of several types of correlation errors 
attributable to alternate, sometimes conflicting data representations required by each the 
simulator client-devices.  The CDB standard achieves this by allowing all simulator 
clients-devices to share, in runtime, a single repository of the synthetic environment 



Open Geospatial Consortium

information.  In addition, a CDB structured data store can also be used as a master 
repository for the authoring tools. As a result CDB content can be interchanged between 
data store workstations.  Finally, in the case where one or more of the client-devices are 
not compliant to the CDB standard, it is possible to revert to the conventional 
compilation paradigm, (i.e., compile the CDB into one or more client-device loadable 
(usually proprietary) representations). 

The actual storage formats of geospatial and model data in a CDB data store is based on 
the native formats, such as TIFF, used by industry-standard toolsets.  This eliminates the 
time-consuming off-line database compilation process for each of the clients.  The CDB 
standard redefines a new balance between offline and online compilation processes 
because modern computer platforms can now accomplish most of the compilation 
process in real-time8. 

The CDB standard addresses the issues that have characterized the simulation industry 
for past decades (see Figure 1: CDB Approach to Synthetic Environment Generation), as 
follows. 

1. Size of Synthetic Environment Storage: The CDB standard specifies how to 
consolidate the synthetic environment into a single data repository that provides a 
static representation of the earth.  This includes all the relevant information so that 
all the simulator client-devices can perform their respective simulation tasks in 
order to meet the training and mission rehearsal requirements.  This approach 
avoids any data content duplication.  Storage intensive datasets can be optionally 
compressed using modern third-party algorithms.  The CDB standard provides a 
fine-grained versioning scheme that avoids the replication of the entire DB when 
effecting small-area updates. 

2. Scalability of Synthetic Environment Database: A CDB structured data store can 
be built to a size or a density that far exceeds the capabilities of some or all of its 
client-devices.  The data structure defined by the CDB standard makes it possible 
to implement runtime filtering schemes to adjust the loaded content density to the 
specific capabilities of the client-devices.  As a result, a CDB structured data store 
can be scaled to take advantage of future simulator technological improvements. 

3. Environment Data Store (DB) Correlation: Since CDB structured content is 
unique (without data duplication), runtime source level correlation errors among 
clients are eliminated, thereby ensuring inter-subsystem coherence and simulator 
interoperability.  In addition, it is possible to improve correlation by adjusting the 
runtime publishing process associated with each client-device. 

4. Database Availability Timeline: The CDB data store generation process allows for 
small incremental updates, thereby shortening generation and build process times.  
Furthermore, the translation step into a CDB structured data store is rather 
straightforward since the industry-standard formats and encodings are used. 

                                                
8 The CDB standard does require however, that most of its dataset be generated in a level-of-detail 
hierarchy.

5. Configuration Management: Configuration management effort is reduced, 
because a single CDB structured data store corresponds to the synthetic 
environment of all the client-devices in the simulator.  Furthermore, while a CDB 
data store instance is conceptually a single, yet layered entity, the standard 
specifies how incremental updates are performed resulting in efficient storage and 
handling of CDB data store versions.

6.3 Use of a CDB conformant data store as an Off-line Data store Repository 
CDB can be used as a structured offline repository. This capability is described in Section 
6.2 Volume 10 Implementation Guidance. 

6.4 Use of a CDB conformant data store as a Combined Off-line and Run-time 
Data store Repository 
A data store conforming to this CDB standard can be both used an offline repository for 
data store authoring tools or as an on-line (or runtime) repository for simulators.  This 
approach is described in Volume 10 Implementation Guidance, section 6.4. 

6.5 Client-Device Independence 
The CDB standard is client-device independent. The standard is based on a requirement 
that all client-devices likely encountered on a tactical mission simulator need to be 
supported. The standard is completely independent of any vendor-specific devices. 

6.6 Runtime Publisher 
The runtime publishers provide the necessary level of abstraction.  The level of 
abstraction provided by the publishers is purely a function of the selected implementation 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

16 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

of the client-device and its associated publishers.  A client-device can “understand” and 
be completely “aware” of a CDB compliant data store as defined by the CDB standard.  
In this case, such a device would not require a runtime publisher, because it is already 
CDB data store native. 

The runtime publishers bridge the gap between the information content requested by the 
attached client-device and the information content and structure available to them in a 
CDB conformant data store.  As a result, the runtime publishers must each be 
theoretically “aware” of the following CDB concepts: 

1. Tile: Ability to understand the concept of earth surface areas hierarchically 
subdivided in accordance to the CDB standard; 

2. Level of detail: Ability to understand the concept of resolution or level-of-detail, for 
terrain, cultural vector data, raster imagery, and model geometry; 

3. Terrain surface representation: Ability to understand concepts pertinent to earth 
surface geometry and related attributes or properties; 

4. Cultural vector data (point, linear, areal): Ability to understand the concept of point, 
linear and areal cultural data and related attribution, fixed or conformed to earth 
surface; 

5. Grid-organized data and meshes: Ability to understand the concept of grid-organized 
single-value datasets (e.g., elevation grid) and multi-value datasets (e.g., color 
triplets); 

6. Imagery: Ability to understand the concept of color raster imagery mapped onto 
terrain surfaces or models; 

7. Model geometry (incl. light points): Ability to understand the concept of general 
surface geometry; 

8. Model positioning capability: Ability to differentiate between statically and 
dynamically positioned models; 

9. Descriptive attribution: Ability to understand the attribution concepts pertinent to the 
client-device. 

 

6.7 Synthetic Environment Scalability & Adaptability 
The concept of scalability when applied to synthetic environments not only applies to the 
geographic extent of the data store but more importantly it also reflects the ability to scale 
the environment in resolution and fidelity.  These concepts are fully supported by the 
CDB Standard and are explained below. 

1. Geographic extent: Correspond to the range of geographic extent of the earth surface 
that can be modeled. 

2. Resolution: Correspond to the range of information density (for instance, the number 
of elevation values per km2) of the modeled datasets. 

3. Fidelity: Correspond to the amount and type of synthetic environment data that can be 
modeled to support higher-fidelity simulator client-devices9.  Consider for instance a 

                                                
9 The CDB standard supports this concept through two mechanisms: 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

17 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

simulator capable of supporting a single-surface earth skin representation versus one 
capable of representing tunnels, bathymetric data, location-dependent tide heights, 
location-dependent wave heights, etc.  Clearly, the amount of information required by 
the higher-fidelity simulator is greater. 

4. Precision: Correspond to the range of numerical precision (i.e., number of bits 
allocated to represent a quantity) of the modeled datasets. 
 

Modelers face difficult challenges if they want a synthetic environment that is both 
scalable and adaptive.  The solution to this difficult issue extends beyond the 
“mechanics” of achieving backward/forward compatibility. The solution also requires a 
complete “dissociation” of the data store from any constraints imposed by client-devices.  
Current practice today is for modelers to repeatedly adjust the content, resolution and 
density of synthetic environment databases to closely match the capabilities and 
performance of the targeted client-devices.  When content is added to the database, 
previously modeled content is usually removed or simplified.  Under such constraints it is 
difficult for a modeler to build a synthetic environment database capable of meeting 
anything but its immediate requirements. 

Figure 2: Typical Evolution of a Database shows the evolution of a modeled region for 
use in a mission rehearsal.  The initial version of the region may have only a few high-
resolution/high-fidelity areas. However, over a given time period modelers will be asked 
to model additional target areas.  As a result, the size, complexity, resolution and fidelity 
of the synthetic environment database gradually increase.  Without built-in provisions for 
scalability, significant rework of the database is required each time a target area is added. 

 
Figure 2: Typical Evolution of a Database 

The CDB standard allows the “dissociation” of the synthetic environment database’s 
extent, resolution, fidelity, precision, structure and format from client-devices.  This 

                                                                                                                                            
 Data defaulting: The CDB standard is tolerant to missing data, because all attributes, layers and 
datasets have Specification default behaviors.  As more of the data is provided, the fidelity of the 
environmental database increases. 

 Additive layering: The CDB standard offers a layered environment database organization.  The 
layer organization is “fidelity-ordered”, (i.e., basic layers appear first in the hierarchy while the layers 
needed for a higher-fidelity simulation appear later in the hierarchy). 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

18

concept is not limited to aspects of formatting, numerical representation, internal 
structure, file structure, file systems, etc.  More importantly the concept also covers 
aspects relating to synthetic environment database fidelity and resolution.  Historically, 
the fidelity and resolution of synthetic environment databases has been intimately linked 
to the capabilities of the targeted simulator client-devices.  More often than not, the 
source data was manipulated and adapted to constraints imposed by the client-devices.  
As a result, the content, resolution and density of synthetic environment databases were 
repeatedly adjusted to closely match the capabilities and performance of the targeted 
client-devices.  The amount of time devoted to repeatedly adding/editing/removing 
content, and then repeatedly re-publishing would largely exceed the effort of creating and 
building the original synthetic environment database.  The CDB standard offers the 
means to break this inter-dependence. 

When assembling a CDB conformant data store, the synthetic environment database 
modeler is permitted (within their time-cost budget) to include content that significantly 
exceeds the capabilities of their simulator(s).  The job of “adjusting” content to client-
devices is relegated to the runtime publishers; the modeler is freed from this labor-
intensive, repetitive task. 

In a typical CDB data store implementation, it is anticipated that client-devices will 
independently control their respective runtime publishers so that the runtime published 
synthetic environment corresponds to their inherent capabilities (resolution, fidelity, etc.). 

Nonetheless, the runtime publishing paradigm offers interesting new possibilities.  For 
instance, it would be possible to individually adjust the fidelity and resolution of the 
synthetic environment for each client-device; this adjustment could be done at any time.  
As a result, it is possible to control and adjust the overall simulator fidelity and 
correlation to a level that was previously unachievable. 

The CDB standard does not enforce a particular computer hardware infrastructure.  The 
selected infrastructure allocated to the handling of a CDB data store is largely determined 
by the overall simulation requirements.  Any leeway the simulator architect may have at 
their disposal when trading-off various simulator performance parameters against each 
other, are as follows: 

1. Geographic extent 
2. SE/Simulator Resolution 
3. SE/Simulator Fidelity 
4. SE/Simulator Precision 
5. Desired level of client-devices correlation 
6. Client-level SE load management 
7. Simulated aircraft speed 
8. CDB sharing 

 

An experienced simulation engineer can typically undertake this analysis. However, the 
process requires a good understanding of the content available in the targeted CDB 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

19

structured databases and of the content each client-device needs in order to meet the 
stated level of performance and fidelity.  

Alternately, it is possible to implement a simulator with client-devices (or attached 
publishers) that are capable of automatically adjusting resolution and fidelity in order to 
overcome performance limitations attributable to the CDB storage infrastructure and/or 
runtime publishers. 

Figure 3: Typical Implementation of the CDB standard on High-end Simulator provides a 
system block diagram of a typical implementation of the CDB standard on a high-end 
tactical flight simulator.  The runtime CDB system serves the combined needs of a 
mission functions computer, an OTW/NVG IG, a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) IG, 
Radar and a Computer Generated Forces (CGF) subsystem equipped with its own terrain 
server.  The runtime CDB data store system is scaled to reflect the collective capabilities 
of the attached client-devices; as a result, the storage system is configured to supply the 
necessary bandwidth.  Similarly, the IO bandwidth of the CDB data store servers and 
processing performance of the runtime publishers are scaled to satisfy the demands of 
their respective client-devices. 

 
Figure 3: Typical Implementation of CDB Standard on High-end Simulator 

Figure 4: Typical Implementation of CDB Standard on Desktop Computer shows a 
modest application of the CDB standard. This approach consists of a single desktop 
computer equipped with both stealth viewer and radar simulation application software.  
Each application is front-ended by a runtime publisher that in turn interfaces to the CDB 
data store via a standard file system.  Given the more modest platform resources, some 



Open Geospatial Consortium

trade-offs in either resolution or fidelity might be required.  This can be implemented in 
the runtime publisher or in the client-device application software. 

 
Figure 4: Typical Implementation of CDB Standard on Desktop Computer 

6.8 Simulator Wide Unique Data Representation 
A CDB data store is a single repository for the entire simulator’s synthetic environment 
data store (aka DB).  The internal structure ensures that all datasets are uniquely 
represented yet available (through a publishing process) to each of the simulator client-
devices at runtime.  This paradigm eliminates the extensive duplication of datasets that 
are shared by two or more client-devices. 

The CDB standard is technically a normalized data storage model in the sense that it best 
meets the logical data design objectives of correctness, consistency, simplicity, non-
redundancy and stability.  Ignoring any tailoring or tuning for particular application 
requirements or performance, a normalized design provides the following advantages. 

1. Minimize amount of space required to store data: Normalization precludes 
storing data items in multiple places. 

2. Minimize risk of data inconsistencies within the data store: Since datasets are 
stored in only one place, there is no risk of datasets becoming inconsistent 
(uncorrelated). 

3. Minimize possible update and delete anomalies: A normalized CDB data store 
eliminates the concerns related to update or delete operations. 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

21

4. Maximize the stability of the data structure: The process of normalization 
helps in associating attributes with entities based on the inherent properties of 
the data rather than on particular application requirements.  Thus, new 
application requirements are less likely to force changes to the CDB 
model/data store design. 

6.9 Key Benefits of the CDB Standard 
The following outline the key benefits of using the CDB standard. 

6.9.1 Improved Synthetic environment Data Store10(DB) Generation Timeline 
Important reductions in both the DB generation and DB update timeline are expected 
from an implementation of the CDB standard because of the following. 

1. There is no need to compile distinct synthetic environment runtime data 
stores for each of the simulator client-devices. 

2. All of the datasets common to two or more client-devices need not be 
duplicated.  All associated client-specific structures are also eliminated. 

3. Tiles and layers are technically independent from each other; as a result, 
there is no need to reprocess neighboring tiles and coincident layers.  
However, one exception to this relates to the level-of-detail generation. 

4. The tile structure permits users to “pipeline” or overlap the DB 
creation/update process, see Figure 5: Pipelined DB Update Process, with 
DB transfer process11. 

 
Figure 5: Pipelined DB Update Process 

5. The tile structure lends itself naturally to the concurrent or “parallel” 
production of the CDB data store. 

6. The internal versioning mechanism lends itself well to CDB structured 
data store updates because only the affected tiles or layers need be re-
transmitted to the simulator.  This represents a significant timesaving, 

                                                
10 Please note that in earlier versions of the CDB standard that the acronym “DB” was used. As DB cases 
confusion regarding whether CDB defines a database or not, the OGC CDB standard uses the term “data 
store”. However, for the sake of backwards compatibility, the use of DB remains in this document. 
11 Assuming the DB toolset (used by the modelers at the DB Generation Facility) allow its users to 
manipulate Environmental DB content on a small-area basis. 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

22

especially in cases where small updates are constantly applied to a 
comparatively large CDB structured data store. 

7. The conversion of the synthetic environment from its tool-native 
representation into a form directly entered by each of the simulator client-
devices is broken down into several publications accomplished in real-
time on behalf of each of client-device.  This approach permits the CDB 
standard representation of the synthetic environment to be “dissociated” 
from the resolution, fidelity, precision, structure and format imposed by 
each client-devices. 

6.9.2 Interoperable Simulation-Ready Synthetic environment Data Store 
A CDB compliant data store is a fully interoperable, simulator-ready synthetic 
environment DB, (i.e., it can be used “as-is” on any CDB-compliant simulator).  Because 
the data store is free of any simulator dependencies, there is no need to undertake a time-
consuming and expensive rework of the runtime data store(s) in order to adapt it (them) 
to the format, structure, content, and precision constraints imposed by the simulator. 

6.9.3 Improved Client-device Robustness/Determinism 
The CDB standard tile organization provides the means to implement deterministic 
loading and/or paging of the data store because each tile corresponds to the same amount 
of data (i.e., a “quanta” of information called a LOD-tile), regardless of its position on 
earth and regardless of its assigned LOD.  This is a key characteristic of the CDB 
standard and is necessary to ensure deterministic operation of client-devices, even when 
the data resolution varies considerably from region to region or when the data is modeled 
at an extremely high-resolution.  It is quite straightforward for a client-device to 
determine the amount of memory it must locally allocate when loading (or paging-in) a 
geographical area of interest.  If the geographical area of interest exceeds the client-
device’s capabilities, it can easily revert to a coarser LOD, hence gracefully degrading, as 
opposed to aborting (due to an internal failure in allocating sufficient memory) or 
“skipping” over the offending area. 

The tile organization lends itself to robust, deterministic management of memory within 
client-devices because memory can be allocated/de-allocated in fixed sized quantities.  
As a result, client-devices need not concern themselves with complex and non-
deterministic memory de-fragmentation schemes that do not lend themselves to real-time 
applications. 

6.9.4 Runtime-Adjustable Synthetic Environment DB Correlation and Fidelity 
The CDB standard plays a critical role in improving the internal correlation of a synthetic 
environment because it eliminates the replication of runtime data stores for each of the 
client-devices.  The prior art in simulation mandated replicated copies of the synthetic 
environment data store. Each copy was constrained by the content, formats, and 
structures specific to each client-device.  As a result, the potential for correlation errors 
abounded.  The CDB standard resolves this issue by defining a single, usable in real-time, 
open, synthetic environment data store representation. 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

23 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The “runtime publishing” paradigm now permits the simulator vendor the means to not 
only control client-device load but to globally re-examine and control the level of 
correlation within a simulator (or across simulators).  While the CDB standard does not 
provide explicit jurisdiction over the implementation of this mechanism in the client-
devices and/or publishers, it is nonetheless possible to improve parametric correlation, at 
runtime, via control of the client-devices/publishers. 

This topic is discussed in more detail in the OGC CDB Best Practice, Volume 1 Section 
1.6.6 , Synthetic Environment Database Correlation. 

6.9.5 Increased Synthetic Environment Data Store Longevity 
The longevity of synthetic environment databases for use in simulation has traditionally 
been a source of considerable aggravation within the user-community. 

Traditionally a considerable level of effort (both human and machine) was required to 
adapt source-level data to a form that is directly usable by each of the simulator client-
devices, also known as the runtime-level vendor-specific database format; this is referred 
to as the “compilation” process.  More often than not, the source data is manipulated and 
adapted to constraints imposed by one or more simulator client-devices.  In most cases, 
the content, resolution and density of synthetic environment databases are repeatedly 
adjusted to closely match the capabilities and performance of the targeted client-devices.  
While it is true that the native tool format database remains independent of the targeted 
client-devices, it is clear that content of the source-level database roughly corresponds to 
the capabilities of the then-current client-devices.  As a result, source-level databases 
become quickly outdated and do require a complete rebuild to take advantage of new 
simulator capabilities. 

The CDB standard avoids these pitfalls because the model does not need to be adapted to 
the constraints imposed by simulator client-devices; that role is relegated to the runtime 
publishers.  Hence, the synthetic environment a CDB data store can be built, right from 
the start, to a level of fidelity commensurate with the anticipated useful life of the 
targeted simulator(s). 

6.9.6 Reduced Synthetic Environment Data Store Storage Infrastructure Cost 
For equivalent synthetic environment content, the CDB standard offers a significant 
storage space savings and significant reductions in the required interconnect 
infrastructure to supply the synthetic environment data to the simulator(s). 

The reduction in equipment and labor can be attributed to the following features. 

1. Simulator-wide unique data representation: eliminate duplication of 
datasets across client-devices. 

2. Compression of storage-intensive datasets: provides effective compression 
of key datasets. 

3. Fine-grain versioning: A CDB structured data store is internally versioned.  
It is possible to revert to prior representations of the SE without restoring 
stored back-ups of the data store.  Because the underlying mechanism is 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

24

fine-grained, only in affected geographic areas or datasets of the data store 
need to be versioned. 

6.10 CDB Model Overview 
The following sections provide a general description and focus of the CDB standard. 

6.10.1 CDB Standard Data Representation and Organization 
The CDB standard provides the means of describing all feature sets relevant to simulation 
(such as terrain and 3D objects).  These feature sets are logical re-groupings of datasets 
that are used directly by the simulator client-devices. 

The standard currently supports the following representations. 

1. Terrain: A representation of the terrain shape/elevation, raster imagery, surface 
attribution and other surface characteristics relevant to distributed simulations. 

2. Point feature: A representation of a single location in space or on the earth’s surface.  
A Point feature consists of a single <latitude, longitude> coordinate with or without 
an elevation.  When a point feature does not have an elevation, it is deemed to be on 
the surface of the earth.  The information includes point-feature type identification, 
location, orientation, connectivity, attribution and other characteristics relevant to 
simulation. 

3. Linear feature (aka LineString): A representation of predominantly man-made multi-
segmented line-oriented features conformed relative to the terrain (such as runways, 
roads, transmission lines, fences).  The information includes linear feature type 
identification, location, orientation, lineal geometry, connectivity, attribution and 
other surface characteristics relevant to simulation. 

4. Areal feature (aka Polygon or area): A representation of closed area features 
conformed relative to the terrain such as forested areas and fields.  The information 
includes areal feature type identification, location, orientation, 2D geometry, 
connectivity, attribution and other surface characteristics relevant to simulation. 

5. 3D cultural model (aka Built Environment): Is a model that is statically positioned on 
the terrain or bathymetry skin.  Cultural models are often a 3D representation of a 
man-made or a natural object positioned and conformed relative to the terrain.  The 
information includes its geometry, articulations, raster imagery (texture, normal map, 
light map, etc.), lighting systems, and other characteristics relevant to simulation. 

6. Moving model: A model that is not fixed at one location in the synthetic environment 
data store.  The simulation host can update the position and orientation of a moving 
model at every simulation iteration cycle.  A moving model is a 3D representation of 
man-made objects free to move within the data store.  The information includes 
feature type identification, (vehicle class, type, model, etc.), geometry, articulations, 
raster imagery (texture, normal map, light map, etc.), lighting systems, connectivity to 
special effects, attribution and other characteristics relevant to simulation 

7. Materials: A symbolic representation of the surface materials for all of the elements 
contained within the data store.  Client-devices are required to simulate the synthetic 
environment over different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum: IR (e.g., FLIR, 
NVG), microwaves (e.g., Radar), audio (e.g., Sonar), etc.  The fidelity of the sensor 
synthetic environment simulation model that runs in each of the client-devices is 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

25 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

highly dependent on the richness and completeness of properties that characterize the 
synthetic environment data store in the electromagnetic spectrum of interest12. 

8. Navigational data: A representation of ARINC-42413 and DAFIF14 data in the form of 
NAVAIDs, Airport/Heliport, Runway/Helipad, Waypoints, Routes, Holding Patterns, 
Airways, Airspace, etc. 

 
In order to represent the above feature sets, the CDB standard logically organizes its data 
in mutually exclusive datasets.  Furthermore, the CDB standard is platform and client-
device independent. As a result, the internal data representation is free of client-device 
specifics and more closely aligned to DB structures/formats supported by prominent 
industry standard tools. 

6.10.2 CDB Standard Logical Structure 
The CDB standard is a structure for simulation and as such its storage structure is 
optimized for simulator client-devices runtime performance.  Therefore, the internal 
storage structure is designed with these specific considerations in mind. 

1. Promotes efficient real-time data access by the simulator client-devices without 
degrading their performance.   

2. Allows simultaneous accesses by all of the various simulator client-devices. 
3. Promotes efficient data store updates and deployment in order to reduce the 

deployment of a CDB structured data store onto one or more simulators. 
 

To address these objectives, the storage structure geographically divides the world into 
tiles (bounded by latitudes and longitudes), each containing a specific set of features 
(such as terrain altimetry, vectors), models, which in turn are represented by the datasets 
(see Figure 6: CDB Standard Tile/Layer Structure).  The datasets define the basic storage 
unit used in a CDB structured data store.  The geographic granularity is at the tile level 
while the information granularity is at the dataset level.  As a result, the storage structure 
permits flexible and efficient updates due to the different levels of granularity with which 
the information can be stored or retrieved.  At the data store generation facility, it is 
                                                
12 One of the primary objectives of this standard is to provide and integrate all of the data required by all 
sensor devices, not just IGs producing the Out-The-Window (OTW) scenes.  In addition, the mandate of 
this standard is to accomplish this objective in a device-independent fashion.  The CDB standard provides a 
means for client-devices to retain their internal Sensor Synthetic Environment Model (SEM), and yet do so 
without introducing device dependencies within the CDB synthetic environment.  To accomplish this 
objective, client-device vendors must provide the appropriate SEM properties for the prescribed CDB Base 
Materials (see Appendix L), since none of the (vendor/device-specific) material properties are stored within 
the CDB 

13 ARINC 424 or ARINC 424 Navigation System Data Base Standard is an international standard file 
format for aircraft navigation data maintained by Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee and published 
by Aeronautical Radio, Inc. The ARINC 424 specifications are not a database, but a "standard for the 
preparation and transmission of data for assembly of airborne navigation system data bases" 
14 Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File is a comprehensive database of up-to-date aeronautical data, 
including information on airports, airways, airspaces, navigation data and other facts relevant to flying in 
the entire world, managed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)

possible to effect small updates, either at the tile level; the feature set level or the dataset 
level.  Similarly, the storage structure fully supports real-time retrieval of content at the 
tile level and the dataset level.  Finally, the incremental versioning mechanism allows 
users to efficiently deploy updates to a data store; only the files whose content differs 
from a prior version need be generated and transferred from the data store generation 
facility to the simulation facility. 

Another benefit of the CDB standard storage structure is its ability to support  concurrent 
generation and deployment. 

 
Figure 6: CDB Standard Tile/Layer Structure 

6.10.3 Tile/Layer/Level-of-Detail Structure 
The CDB standard offers a structure that is well suited for the efficient access of its 
contents.  To this end, it relies on three important means to organize the synthetic 
environment data: 

• Tiles 
• Layers 
• Level-of-Detail (LOD) 

6.10.3.1 Tiles 
The CDB standard defines a top-level tile structure designed to organize the data for 
efficient access in real-time.  The tile structure provides an effective means for simulator 
client-devices to access the datasets of a geographical area at a selected LOD.  Since the 
spatial dimension of tiles varies inversely with LOD (i.e., resolution), client-devices can 
readily predict the amount of data contained within the tile; as a result, the management 
of memory within client-devices is simplified and much more deterministic. 



Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

27 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The CDB standard Conceptual Model is logically organized as a strip of geo-unit aligned 
tiles along each earth slice.  Each earth slice is divided into a decreasing number of tiles 
to account for the fact that the length of an earth slice decreases with increasing latitude. 

6.10.3.2 Layers 
The CDB model is also logically organized as distinct layers of information.  The layers 
are theoretically independent from each other, (i.e., changes in one layer do not impose 
changes in other layers). 

Layers are additive in fidelity, (i.e., the achievable level of the simulation fidelity 
increases with the number of layers). 

Secondly, unavailable layers are automatically defaulted.  A database modeler need not 
fully populate a CDB structured data store.  There is no mandatory “coverage 
completeness requirement” imposed by the CDB standard.  This feature permits the 
generation of a CDB conformant data store even when database modelers are confronted 
with limited data availability.  The usefulness/faithfulness of the synthetic environment 
increases with the number of available layers. 

The layering mechanism improves the efficiency of the client-devices since they need 
only access (and be aware) of the datasets that are relevant to them, at their prescribed 
level of fidelity.  For instance, a simulator CGF client-device will not likely have a reason 
to use ground raster imagery. However, it is quite likely interested in accessing ground 
surface properties when determining traffic-ability. 

6.10.3.3 Levels of Detail (LOD) 
Level of detail (LoD) is a concept available in various disciplines from computer 
graphics and cartography to electrical circuit design. For GIS practitioners, the discipline 
where level of detail is most relevant and well known is 3D city modelling. In the CDB, 
LOD is a mechanism for allowing increasing levels of fidelity without impacting system 
performance. In CDB data stores, LODs are also an integral part of the physical database 
structure. The LOD requirement for simulation systems is similar with regard to 
requirements for increased fidelity in 3d City Models and standards such as CityGML.  

The availability of LOD representations is critical to real-time performance, especially 
when dealing with grid-organized data.  Most simulation client-devices can readily take 
advantage of a LOD structure because, in many cases, less detail/information is necessary 
at increasing distances from the simulated object.  As a result, many client-devices can 
reduce (by 100-fold or more) the required bandwidth to access synthetic environment 
data in real-time. 

Additionally, the availability of LODs can be readily exploited by simulator client-
devices to improve algorithmic efficiency.  Devices such as Image Generators (IGs) can 
readily take advantage of an LOD structure because image perspective naturally reduces 
image detail with distance as a result of the perspective computation inherent to the IG. 
As a result, much less geometric detail and texture detail need be processed or considered 
at far range.

The spatial sampling of each successive LOD in a CDB data store follows power of two 
progressions. This is a prerequisite for the efficient and deterministic management of 
memory by all client-devices of a typical simulator. 

The terrain LOD can be controlled to the tile level.  Since the CDB standard specifies a 
variable LOD hierarchy spanning up to 34 levels, it is possible to control the allocation of 
LODs by area.  The variable LOD hierarchy provides for efficient use of storage because 
the LOD hierarchy needs to be deepened only in the areas where higher resolution is 
desired. Figure 7: Variable Allocation of LOD, illustrates an earth strip made up of a 
series of tiles; some portions of the strip have been modeled with 3, 4, or 5 LODs 
according to the application requirements.

6.10.4 CDB Structure, Organization on Media and Conventions 
This CDB standard along with the CDB Best Practices describes the data content, 
representation, as well as the logical organization of the data stored in the data store:

1. The Data store structure comprises all of the data structures used to access data store 
content (such as file paths, Level-of-Detail (LOD), lists) to speed up access, 
information layering, versioning and configuration management; and 

2. Naming Conventions: Used to describe a naming hierarchy for cultural models, 
moving models, lights and model components. 

6.10.4.1 Other Applications of the CDB Standard 
While the CDB standard was initially targeted primarily for use in Special Operations 
simulator applications, it is entirely suited to a broad range of other applications that 
make use of the same datasets; these include (and are not limited to): 

1. Ground warfare simulation 
2. Anti-submarine warfare 
3. Visualization 
4. Modeling and Simulation 
5. Urban Planning 
6. Natural Resource Management 
7. Emergency Management 

 

The implementation of the CDB standard on legacy simulator client-devices usually 
mandates the use of the runtime publishers. These costs are largely offset by the 
consolidation (and substantial reduction) of storage and associated infrastructure.  In the 
future, it is anticipated that the runtime publishing computer infrastructure will be largely 
“absorbed” by higher performance client-devices that will natively process the data store 
without an intermediate conversion into a legacy internal format. 

In applications that are less demanding than flight simulation, the CDB standard can be 
implemented without resorting to high-performance computer platforms.  For instance, 
the simulator repository mass storage system (shown in Figure 8: Typical CDB 
Implementation on a Suite of Simulators) can be a single disk storage device.  In 
demanding applications, the simulator repository can be implemented as a large-scale 
Storage Area Network (SAN).  Similarly, the Update Manager IUM), the CDB server and 
each of the client-device runtime publishers can be implemented as software tasks within 
a single computer platform, or can even be migrated to software tasks running internally 
within the client-devices.  Figure 4, Typical Implementation of CDB Standard on Desktop 
Computer, illustrates a desktop trainer consisting of a stealth viewer15 and radar 
simulations, implemented as software applications running on a single computer 
platform; both applications pull their synthetic environment data from a disk-resident 
CDB. 

6.10.5 Use of CDB in Applications Requiring Dynamic Synthetic Environments 
A CDB-compliant simulator already incorporates most of the architectural features 
required to support the handling of Dynamic Synthetic Environments (aka DSE).  Figure 

                                                
15 A ‘stealth viewer’ is analogous to a camera viewpoint that is not ‘attached’ to any physical entity in a 
simulation

1-14, Versioning Paradigm Applied to Dynamic SE, illustrates how CDB-compliant 
simulator architecture can be extended to permit the runtime modification of the CDB.  
This can be accomplished by leveraging simulator architectures that natively adhere to 
the CDB data schema and to the CDB versioning capabilities. 

This capability requires that the simulator be equipped with a Dynamic Synthetic 
Environment Generator whose interfaces conform to the CDB standard; all other 
elements of the simulator architecture are identical to those of a CDB-compliant 
simulator. 

Two applications of this principle could be envisaged. 

1. DB update from DIS:  This is the so-called “Dynamic Terrain/Synthetic 
Environment”, where a group of confederates interoperate over a DIS 
network by receiving update commands that trigger runtime modification 
of the CDB. 

2. DB creation/update from live data feed:  Terrain areas could be created or 
modified on-the-fly, based on live data (such as terrain imagery or LIDAR 
data transmitted by a UAV) and provided instantly to the confederates.
