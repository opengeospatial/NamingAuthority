OGC Moving Features consists of the following parts under the general title Moving Features Encoding:

 -      Part I:XML Core

-      Part II:Simple CSV

 
 

                

                
                        
                                vii. Introduction

                        
Applications using moving feature data, typically representing vehicles or pedestrians, are rapidly increasing. Innovative applications are expected to require the overlay and integration of moving feature data from different sources to create greater social and business value. Examples of applications that require integrated simulation are disaster risk management, traffic information services, security services, navigation for robots, aviation or maritime traffic monitoring, and wildlife tracking and conservation. Moreover, systems relying on single-source moving feature data are now evolving into more integrated systems. Integration of moving feature data from different sources is a key to developing more innovative and advanced applications.

 Efforts in this direction therefore should be encouraged by ensuring smoother data exchange because handling and integrating moving feature data will broaden the market for geo-spatial information such as Geospatial Big Data Analysis. ISO 19141:2008 is an existing abstract standard to model moving features; however encoding method is not provided.

Therefore, an XML (and GML) style encoding for Moving Features is standardized. The defined encoding standard is ISO 19141:2008 Geographic Information – Schema for Moving Features compliant implementation standard applicable for massive data handling.  ISO 19141:2008 defines a method to describe the geometry of a feature that moves as a rigid body.




                
                        1. Scope

This OGC® Standard specifies an encoding format to describe the geometries of many features that move as rigid bodies. This OGC Standard is applicable to features having the following characteristics.

	 Each moving feature can be described with Schema for Moving Features (ISO19141: 2008).
	 The number of features simultaneously encoded with this format can be massive (many thousands of features).
	 All features can be described using common space-time coordinates.


This standard does not address all types of moving features. Examples of features that are out of scope include the following:

	 Deforming features, such as flood water.
	 Feature’s geometric representation should not be encoded inline in a geometric complex that contains the geometric representations of other features, since this would require the other features’ representations to be updated as the feature moves.


This standard is focused on the encoding format, thus Web interface and inertial data models are out of scope also.


                                2. Conformance

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative).

                                3. Normative References

	<<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information.
	 <<CodeList>> is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential values.



In this standard, the following standard data types are used:
        
	 CharacterString – A sequence of characters
	Integer – An integer number
	 Double – A double precision floating point number
	Float – A single precision floating point number



5.3 XML Namespaces

All components of the Moving Feature XML schema are defined in the namespace with the identifier “http://www.opengis.net/movingfeatures/1.0”, for which the prefix mf or the default namespace is used within this Standard. 


6. Data Model Overview

6.1 Concepts and standard modularity

Figure 1 illustrates the standard components for encoding and communicating Moving Features data.  The four boxes drawn in the figure portray the four modules defined in the OGC® Moving Features standard.

OGC® Moving Features Simple CSV Encoding and Simple Binary Encoding are fundamental and are data formats to describe moving points and their trajectories. The formats are designed to encode trajectories of moving points compactly as application schemas of IETF RFC 4180 (CSV), NetCDF Discrete Sampling Geometry and so on.

OGC® Moving Features Core, defined in this document, is represented by an XML data encoding for moving points and their trajectories. The format is an extensible format to model and encode movement data for features encoded as point geometries .

OGC® Moving Features 1D/2D Geometry and OGC® Moving Features 3D Geometry are defined to encode moving features that have more complex geometries.

Two UML packages are defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO 19141:2008]: “Geometry Types” and “Prism Geometry”.  “Geometry Types” defines the description model of movements including the paths. “Prism Geometry” defines the moving geometry. The two squares drawn with broken lines in Fig. 1 correspond to these packages. The square labeled as “<<Prism Geometry>>” is an implementation of “Prism Geometry”; the square labeled as “<<Geometry Types>>” is an implementation of “Geometry Types.”

6.2 Foliation and prisms

Figure 2 illustrates the concepts of foliation, prism, trajectory, and leaf, which are defined in ISO19141:2008[ISO 19141:2008]. In this illustration, a 2D rectangle moves and rotates. Each representation of the rectangle at a given time is a leaf. The path traced by each corner point of the rectangle is a trajectory. The set of points contained in all of the leaves, and in all of the trajectories, forms a prism. The set of leaves also forms a foliation.

The prism of the moving feature can be viewed as a bundle of trajectories of points on the local engineering representation of the feature’s geometry. If viewed in a 4 dimensional spatio-temporal coordinate system, the points on the feature at different times are different points.

6.3 XML Implementation

An XML data encoding is defined in this standard for implementing the foliation data model. Note that massive amounts of moving feature data may need to be described with this format. Therefore, the data encoding should be compact and easy to handle. Figure 3 illustrates an importing process for a document written in the XML data format. When dealing with massive numbers of moving features, the entire data set may not be able to be loaded into memory. Therefore, the XML data should be parsed on-the-fly. This means that all information needed for interpretation of the XML data should appear at the head of the document. Thus, the XML document written has two main parts: header part and body part. The header part, which is implemented as meta elements, includes meta information for the XML data. The body part, which is implemented as foliation elements, includes the movement information for moving features.


    
    

            
		
                    
                            Figure : XML parsing 
                    
            
    

    
6.4 Time ordered encoding

Figure 4 shows an example for trajectories of three moving points A, B and C. Each trajectory has the start time and the end time. At t=0 (start of all data), all points start moving. Then, at t =1, the movement of A is changed. In the case, the trajectory of A from t=0 to t=1, the trajectory of A from t=1 to t=2, the trajectory of B from t=0 to t=2, and the trajectory of C from t=0 to t=2 are encoded. This means that only changes of state, including moving-speed, direction, existence, and attributes, are encoded in the format. The encoded changes of state are ordered by time in order to determine the states of all features even if only the first half of data is loaded.

Annex B

 Application examples


B.1 Transportation survey with smart phones

Traffic congestion is a serious problem in many cities. Basically, two types of solutions are applied to resolve congestion: road-construction and enhancement of public transportation systems. Both of the solutions require information on trip demands: the number of people’s movements between two places, because roads and public transportation systems should make connection between the pairs of places that have the highest trip demand. Therefore, the trip demands should be figured out by transportation survey.

Questionnaires are traditionally used to survey trip demands. However, because GPS enabled smart-phones are now available, GPS based research is applicable as a sampling alternative. The GPS tracks are encoded by Moving Features standard in order to be shared by many stakeholders like local governments, bus companies, and so on.

B.2 Maritime sector use case

Several devices have been used by vessels to track their positions. Some of these devices are mandatory as required by regional/international standardization initiatives (i.e. EU Directives, IMO conventions, etc …).

The scope to track the position of the vessels is twofold: increase the safety and security within the maritime sector.

In order to address maritime use cases the Moving Feature standard has to include at least the following information: (i) ship position, which can be provided by different data source (AIS, LRIT, etc …); and (ii) ship voyage, which describe the track of vessels. Additional information about the vessel incidents and the ship particulars has to be considered complementary, therefore as possible extensions to the Moving Feature standard. For example the following figure summarize the information collected by the Canonical Data Format produced by the European Maritime Safety Agency


    
    

            
		
            
    

    
 

The following picture reports the last position of vessels within a specific area (black triangle), and the track of a specific vessel (yellow triangles). In this case the yellow triangles report the position of a specific vessel every 6 minutes in the last 24 hours. Furthermore additional information as: heading, true heading and speed is recorded for enrich the description of the vessel track.


    
    

            
		
            
    

    
 

A vessel has a unique identification at a worldwide scale (IMO number, or MMSI), the position of a vessel (ship position) is a point feature over the time. The voyage feature of a vessel (ship voyage) is characterized by several attributes such as: speed over the ground, course over the ground, heading and true heading.

To build the trajectory of a vessel, two main abstract feature types are relevant for Moving Feature standard: ship position and ship voyage.

Possible uses of the information collected by maritime authorities are:

B.3 Aviation sector use case

Aircraft and other airborne vehicles are obviously moving features as well. The aviation sector has a (large) number of methods to track aircraft and to represent their position.

The main sources of data include the following 

	Primary surveillance radar: Radar equipment measuring position and heading of aircraft.
	Secondary surveillance radar: position detection is augmented with an active response from the aircraft’s transponder. It supplies additional information such as its identity.
	ADS-B: aircraft with on board GPS or other GNSS equipment may also provide position information based on the GPS measurement. This mode of position and information broadcasting is called ADS-B and is seen as an important future tool for increasing air traffic capacity and safety.


The position and related data of aircraft is encoded according to different standards. One standard is Eurocontrol ASTERIX (http://www.eurocontrol.int/asterix). ASTERIX defines different categories, most categories containing position data according to a different detection method.

For instance, category 48 defines the following fields (copied from the Cat 48 specification on http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/specifications-documents )

The items in bold relate to the position, heading, time, and identity of the aircraft. Other information fields provide metadata on quality, data source, etc.

Other ASTERIX categories provide different sets of information where position and other information may also be encoded in different ways. Some interesting aspects to ASTERIX:

	The positions may be expressed in relation to the radar equipment position. A (separately available) position of the radar is thus needed to correctly geo-reference the aircraft.
	The data has a binary encoding optimized to obtain a small message size. Verbose GML/XML encoding may be a barrier for adoption of the Moving Feature standard for large data sets in the aviation world.
	Many data sets do not include all fields. Optional elements in the Moving Features may accommodate representing such data sets.
	Some categories or data sets do not include an identification of the moving features. Such data is often referred to as ‘plots’. Since multiple plots cannot be related to a single aircraft, the data set basically is a bag of time-stamped points.


FAA has an Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) feed, which provides aircraft position reports as a convenient data feed to industry. The feed also includes information on flight plans (the planned route of the aircraft). See http://www.fly.faa.gov/ASDI/asdi.html for more information.

In order to address aviation use cases at least this information must be managed in the moving feature standards. Other information is important as well and may be encoded as use-case specific metadata.

Possible uses of the information collected by aviation authorities are:

Use cases can also involve analysis afterwards (incident analysis, statistics, etc.) or simulated air traffic. The moving features standard may be useful to convert raw feeds into a standard moving features representation for use in generic analysis and processing tools.

 




B.4 A Use case for Hurricanes

Tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons are extremely energetic and dangerous weather phenomena with a pronounced centre of rotation, the ‘eye’. However, their position can be forecast, with increasing accuracy, several days in advance, and even more accurately only a day in advance. These forecasts are normally presented to the general public and emergency services as a simple graphical map, often using PNG or JPEG formats.

Hurricanes and typhoons are the same phenomenon, but traditionally the names in the western Pacific and western Atlantic are different. A tropical storm is a weaker version, causing less damage, but can become more energetic. Currently a wind speed threshold of 65 knots (120Km/hour, 75 miles/hour) is the only distinguishing attribute.

Typically a deterministic chart will show a single forecast storm trajectory as a single track with the location of the storm centre or ‘eye’ indicated at regular intervals, say every 6 or 12 hours. The location at a specific time is usually marked by specific symbols, standardised across all countries for both meteorology and aviation.

Sometimes a probabilistic chart is preferred, and a range of possible trajectories, or an envelope of these trajectories is used. The set of trajectories may come from a single forecast centre using an ensemble of possible forecasts, or the set may be from several forecast centres which all produce slightly different forecasts. Generally, if the spatial, and temporal, spread of the set of trajectories is small, then more confidence is attached to them than if the spread is great.

Expert users, such as forecasters, may also use a chart that displays ranges of trajectories from successive forecast times, and the actual trajectory so far. Again, similarity in these successive forecasts gives increased confidence in the accuracy of the forecasts.

If graphical output is inappropriate, there is a standardised simple text message used to transmit the current and forecast locations across emergency communications channels. These messages also include the actual and forecast wind speeds at various distances and directions from the ‘eye’. The atmospheric pressure near the eye may also be included.

The central pressure is an important indicator of damage, like the wind speed, as the reduced pressure causes the local sea surface to rise by a few metres causing flooding and destructive waves.

The sea surface temperature in the path of the storm is also important, as this determines whether the storm will increase or decrease in strength.

So there are a number of changing attributes need to be associated with the storm and its trajectory.

B.5 Predicting Crime patterns by simulating movement of criminals, victims and police on map

Goal: To replicate the conditions under which crime is committed and predict crime patterns, for example predicting regions more vulnerable to crime based on Routine Activity Theory.

Setup: All these phenomena move only along roads on the map. There are certain fixed marked spots on the map. These include Criminal’s Home, Office, Mall, Bar, Restaurants. There is a weekly schedule and the criminal agent moves between these spots based on the schedule.

Forms of Motion:

	 Beeline Movement: The agent chooses one of the shortest 3 paths between two spots randomly and moves along it. This is time bound - if there are less than 3 routes that can be covered in the amount of time the agent has - only that number of routes are considered for random selection.
	 Random Movement: Agent starts from source and at each road intersection, agent chooses a road randomly and moves along it. This is also time bound - when time runs out, the agent moves to the destination along the shortest path from its current location.
	 Hybrid Movement: Agent moves between source and destination along the shortest path with deviations. Agent randomly chooses two points on the shortest route and takes a longer different route between these two points. If there is time remaining, agent repeats this, otherwise moves to the destination along the shortest path.


Prediction of Crime Patterns: Criminal Agent, Victim Agents and Police all keep moving along the map as per their schedules. There are a number of designated crime spots on the map. When the criminal agent passes through the vicinity of a crime spot, it decides whether or not to commit crime based on factors like profit value associated with crime spot, risk involved, presence of police nearby, absence of guardian of spot and the number of times the spot has been visited before. Crime Patterns are predicted by running this simulation a very large number of times.

Discussion:

	 The simulation needs a city description with roads and buildings of interest. CityGML could be used here.
	 The simulation needs to represent the agent’s trajectory in the above-cited city. Moving Features standard would be used here.
	 The trajectory is repeated weekly with random variations. That may be represented as a “base line” moving feature. This base line would not describe a real moving feature, but would be used as a template.
	 Interactions between the environment (CityGML) and the moving features may trigger events. For example when <mf:Trajectory> value become close to a CityGML feature or interest having a low “presence of police” attribute, a crime may occur depending on the value of that attribute and other attributes like “absence of guardian”, “profit”, and “risk”.

Example: The criminal agent moves between Home, Office, Bar, Lunch-A, Lunch-B, Mall marked on the map as per a weekly schedule. The result corresponds to the weekly schedule run for 500 times on the city: Indianapolis. The small squares on the map correspond to crime spots. The color of each crime spot represents the number of times crime has been committed at that spot, normalized on a scale of 0-100.


    
    

            
		
            
    

    
 

B.6 Use-Cases for Soccer Matches

Background: It is an important task of soccer coaches to analyze matches for developing proper tactics and preparing for future matches. With recent progress of several video analysis and sensor technologies, it is now possible to gather match data including trajectories of both players and the ball.

 

Feature Modelling [1]: A soccer match is composed of 23 moving features including 22 players and ball, where each moving feature has p(x,y) or p(x,y,z) coordinates for each time instance during a match. A sequence of moving point for a player or ball forms a trajectory. A basic feature model for soccer match in terms of moving feature is given as the following figure.

We define two abstract feature types Point Feature and Point Trajectory Feature as the root classes of the model of figure 1, which correspond to spatial and spatiotemporal objects respectively. And Ball and Player, which inherit from Point Feature, have the coordinates of the ball and players at each sampling time instance. Ball Trajectory and Player Trajectory represent the feature types of ball and player trajectories respectively. Each object of Point Feature has (x, y) coordinates at each time instance t. Note that we employ (x, y)-coordinate reference system to specify the position of spatial objects from the left-bottom corner of the field. And we assume the continuity of temporal domain even though there may be several breaks of match such as ball-out. Due to the breaks, we cannot assure the continuity of the ball trajectory. Since soccer is a collective sport, it is required to analyze the positions of players as a collection as well as position of each individual player. For example, the defensive tactics would be better understood by analyzing the shape of the defensive players in a collective way, rather than the position of each individual defender separately. For this reason, we define Collective Feature and Collective Trajectory. We may define additional properties for player such as direction.

 

Based on the information of this basic feature model, we can derive more useful information from primitive behaviours such as kicks, ball possession, dribbles (see figure 2), intercepts, passes, to complicated strategies such as formation, defence or attack systems.
