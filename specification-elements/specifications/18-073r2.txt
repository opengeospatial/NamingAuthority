i. Abstract

Information Assurance (IA)[1] Controls for OGC Web Services (OWS) have been implemented for years. However, these implementations break interoperability, as they are not standardized by OGC Web Service standards. Interoperability between secured OGC Web Services and clients is limited to systems custom built to work with an IA implementation.

The goal of the OWS Common Security Standard is to allow the implementation of IA controls and to advertise their existence in an interoperable way with minimal impact to existing implementations using a backwards-compatible approach. That goal is being pursued in two ways:

Identify and document IA Controls for supporting authentication in a register maintained through the OGC.

Specify how a service can advertise their IA controls through the Service Capabilities Document.

This OGC standard applies to OWS deployed on HTTPS. It specifies how conformant OWS Services shall advertise their IA Controls and additional security features. The advertisement uses XML elements that are already part of the Capabilities document structure. This ensures that existing client implementations will not break.

The standard also describes the governance process for the IA Control registers, examples of register contents, and descriptions on how this information should be used.

Next, this standard defines conformance classes and requirements classes to be used for reaching compliance and their validation via conformance tests.

Finally, this standard defines client behavior to ensure interoperable processing of advertised security controls.

iii. Preface

This is version 1.0 of the OGC Web Services Security standard submitted to the Technical Committee by the OWS Common – Security Standards Working Group.

This document standardizes an annotation mechanism for Capabilities documents or responses to the GetCapabilities request, ensuring interoperability between a secured OGC Web Service instance deployed on HTTPS and a client application. It further overrides existing HTTP protocol limitations and exception handling for existing OGC Web Services standards for the purpose of achieving interoperability with main stream IT security standards and their implementations. To achieve this, no changes to existing OGC Abstract specifications and OGC Web Services standards are required.

This standard has no direct precursor document but can be seen as the result of previous OGC Testbeds, documented in different Testbed Engineering Reports (see bibliography).

The annotation approach and the service behavior regarding security is standardized in a backwards compatible way to ensure it can be applied to existing OGC Web Services with no change to the deployments.

The implication to be compliant with this standard is that some requirements from existing OGC standards are superseded. Because this standard defines the compliance, it is not required to incorporate the requirements into the existing standards. Therefore no change requests to the existing OGC standards are required!

Uptake of the standardized approach by new OGC Web Services standards will ensure security interoperability.

1. Scope (informative)
This standard applies to a deployed OGC Web Service instance for which the protocol scheme of all operation endpoint URLs, exposed in the Capabilities document, is ‘https’ as defined in RFC 7230, section 2.7.2.

A security-annotated Capabilities document is one which uses the <Constraint> element(s) to express the existence of security controls on the operation of the service instance or support for a particular security feature. Applying the tests as defined in the Annexes can validate compliance for a service, the client and the OGC management process. Basically, a service can be described by a Capabilities document that includes security annotations as defined in this standard. A client loading these Capabilities and parse for the <Constraint> element(s) can determine the security controls implemented for each operation of the service instance. The string value of this element’s name attribute contains the identifier of the implemented requirements class.

How the client obtains the security-annotated capabilities is out of scope for this standard.

This standard defines one common abstract Requirements Class and three Capabilities document structure specific Requirements Classes. The structure specific classes address how the requirements are implemented for WMS 1.1.1, WMS 1.3 and OWS Common based service Capabilities documents.

Requirements Class Common Security: This abstract class ensures that the service instance is implementing HTTPS as specified by the IETF RFCs [e.g. RFC 7230]. This is the minimum capability required to be interoperable with mainstream IT security technology. Common Security bundles mandatory requirements classes that address issues which inhibit operating an OGC compliant web service over HTTPS. This Requirements Class also provides a method for the client to use either the service exception handling compliant with OWS Common (for the OWS layer) or exception handling compliant with the HTTP specification for the security layer. This method ensures the elimination of unnecessary limitations regarding the HTTP protocol and exception handling from OWS Common and other OGC Web Service standards. This standard also defines other optional requirements classes that address the description of further IAs to be able to convey as much information on existing security controls as possible.

The following Requirements Classes are concerned with how to apply the actual security annotations to the Capabilities document that is associated with a service endpoint. There are three different Requirements Classes because the way to insert security annotations into the Capabilities document differs based on the underlying XML schema or DTD.

Requirements Class OWS Common: This class defines how the security metadata is to be inserted into the OGC Web Service Capabilities document for any service instance based on OWS Common XML schema.

Requirements Class WMS 1.1.1: This class defines how the security metadata is to be inserted into the OGC Web Service Capabilities document for a WMS 1.1.0 service instance based on the WMS 1.1.1 DTD.

Requirements Class WMS 1.3.0: This class defines how the security metadata is to be inserted into the OGC Web Service Capabilities document for a WMS 1.3.0 service instance based on the WMS 1.3.0 XML schema.

Figure 1. Relationships between requirements classes (simplified overview)
The implication to be compliant with this standard is that some requirements from existing OGC standards are superseded. Because this standard defines the compliance, it is not required to incorporate the requirements into the existing standards. Therefore no change requests to the existing OGC standards are required!

The following OGC standards are directly affected:

OWS Common 1.1.0, OGC 06-121r3 OGC Web Services Common Specification, OGC® Implementation Standard

OWS Common 2.0.0, OGC 06-121r9 OGC Web Services Common Specification, OGC® Implementation Standard

WMS 1.1.1, OGC 01-068r3 Web Map Service Implementation Specification

WMS 1.3.0, OGC 06-042 OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS) Implementation Specification

The following OGC standards are impacted because they inherit from OWS Common.

WFS 1.1.0, OGC 04-094 OpenGIS Web Feature Service (WFS) Implementation Specification

WFS 2.0, OGC 09-025r1 OpenGIS Web Feature Service 2.0 Interface Standard (also ISO 19142)

WFS 2.0.2, OGC 09-025r2 OGC® Web Feature Service 2.0 Interface Standard – With Corrigendum

WCS 2.0, OGC 09-147r3 OGC® WCS Interface Standard - KVP Protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.1

WCS 2.0, OGC 09-148r1 OGC® WCS - XML/POST Protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0

WCS 2.0, OGC 09-149r1 OGC® Web Coverage Service 2.0 Interface Standard - XML/SOAP Protocol Binding Extension, version 1.0.0

WMTS 1.0, OGC 07-057r7 OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service Implementation Standard

WPS 1.0.0, OGC 05-007r7 Web Processing Service

WPS 2.0, OGC 14-065 OGC® WPS 2.0 Interface Standard

SOS 2.0, OGC 12-006 OGC® Sensor Observation Service Interface Standard

SPS 2.0, OGC 09-000 OGC® Sensor Planning Service Implementation Standard

CSW 2.0.2, OGC 07-006r1 OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation Specification

CSW 3.0, OGC 12-176r7 OGC® Catalogue Services 3.0 Specification - HTTP Protocol Binding

One typical way to realize compliance without modifying the existing service implementations is via a security gateway or proxy. This proxy would have the duty to implement the compliance by injecting security annotations into the GetCapabilities response, operate the service endpoint on HTTPS but also support all HTTP methods and correct the OWS Common error code handling. Testbed 12 ER OGC16-048 describes a practical approach of a security proxy.

4.2. Versioning

The version of this standard can be maintained independent from the version of the Authentication Codelist, a Conformance or Requirements Class. Including the version in the standard URI as well as in the URNs ensures this.

4.3. Backwards Compatibility

This standard leverages the existing OWS Constraint element to enable the annotation of service capabilities with IA controls present on operation(s) of the service instance. This solution ensures backwards compatibility, as a Capabilities document that includes security annotations is valid against the existing OWS Common schema. For WMS 1.1.1 and WMS 1.3.0, which do not make use of OWS Common, a similar approach is standardized ensuring backwards compatibility.

All approaches ensure that a service endpoint can, independent from anything else, provide service Capabilities with security annotations. Client applications not capable of interpreting the annotations will simply ignore them but will not return expected results. Clients however, that properly interpret the security annotation can use that information to ensure interoperable functioning with secured OGC Web Services.

5. Use Cases (informative)
NOTE
This standard does not require the use of a catalogue service to obtain the service metadata. This section includes a catalogue to fully illustrate the find-bind process for protected OGC Web Services.
The following use cases provide an overview on how to use annotated Capabilities. The term “annotated Capabilities” refers to the extension of a Capabilities document as defined by this standard. In the OGC world of services, the paradigm Publish-Find-Bind is based on a service / data provider describing the service with metadata, e.g. using ISO 19139 and registering that description. For the purpose of this standard, we assume that the metadata is stored in a catalogue service. From the catalogue service, the metadata for the service’s data and for the service itself can be found. For this specification, it is out of scope to describe the security annotations in ISO 19139 metadata. However, note that the service metadata, in the catalogue, contains a link to the service capabilities. This is usually the GetCapabilities operation of the actual service. For the use of annotated capabilities, this link must be freely accessible and therefore perhaps is a different URL (not the GetCapabilities operation of the actual secured service). Knowledge of the service “content” is restricted. Therefore public access to the annotated capabilities must be in compliance with the “need-to-know” principle. The following use cases illustrate the different combinations that might exist:

5.1. Use Case 0: Public Service / Public Data / Public Catalogue / Public Communication

This is the current standardized use of OGC Web Services – no security. Therefore, there are no implications for this standard.

Services can be discovered through a catalogue that has no security.

The client application can bind to the service instance via the Capabilities document. This reflects common practice for today’s SDIs.

5.2. Use Case I: Authenticated Public Service / Public Data / Public Catalogue / Secure Communication

This is another common use of OGC Web Services – no client authentication or authorization is used – only server authentication and a protected communication channel. The server authentication assures the client has the authentic source of the public data. The secure communication channel ensures privacy to the client. Outsiders cannot determine what data the client is receiving.

As server authentication methods are not currently specified in OGC Web Services, there are implications for this standard. In the most common case (HTTPS) server authentication and protected communications is not strictly compliant with existing OGC Web Services standards. This standard corrects that oversight.

The client application can bind to the service instance via the Capabilities document. This reflects common practice for today’s SDIs. The client needs to support the server authentication method while accessing the public data on the server, e.g. support for HTTPS.

5.3. Use Case II: Protected Service / Open Data / Public Catalogue / Secure Communication

For this use case, a public catalogue holds data and service metadata for a protected service. The public access to the catalogue implies that authentication is not required. It is therefore not possible to provide user specific responses. The user can discover service metadata that point to the public version of the annotated Capabilities.

Open data implies that the need-to-know principle does not apply. Therefore, the annotated Capabilities, accessible from a free and open URL, must contain all information relevant for the client application to bind to the service. In particular, this requires that the “content” section of the annotated capabilities list all accessible resources.

Any service that fits the description of use case II should include a “content” section in the annotated Capabilities that lists all accessible resources.

A client application that has implemented all the published security requirements is able to bind to the service and work with the Capabilities document in the usual fashion – likewise to use case 0.

The main difference with use case I is that both user and server are authenticated. Data is open but anonymous access is not allowed.

5.4. Use Case III: Protected Service / Private Data / Public Catalogue

This use case is similar to use case II with the exception that the service provides access to private data. This must trigger the need-to-know constraint, which implies that the “content” section of the annotated Capabilities is empty or other indications exist from which the client application can conclude that the service is providing private resources. One example is the Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) profile for the WFS Web Service that uses the <AccessContraints> element of the Capabilities to indicate the highest level of classification.

NOTE
The Capabilities document can have multiple <AccessContraints> elements.
In this case, the client application can only expect that the annotated Capabilities contain the <OperationsMetadata> element. Therefore, the client application is first required to determine its ability to comply with the security requirements outlined in the annotations. In cases where the application is interoperable with the security on the protected service instance, the client must execute the advertised GetCapabilities operation and comply with the security constraints to fetch the full Capabilities that include the “Content” section.

If the annotated Capabilities document does not contain a “content” section (<Layer> element for WMS or a <FeatureTypeList> element for a WFS or a <Contents> element for WMTS, WCS or WPS) or the <AccessContraints> element does not contain the literal “None”, the application shall [3] execute the GetCapabilities operation advertised (within the Capabilities document) to fetch the full service capabilities.

NOTE
The description above assumes that the client is able to function on the advertised security requirements for the GetCapabilities operation.
5.5. Use Case IV: Protected Service / Private Data / Protected Catalogue / Secure Communication

This use case assumes that managed access to the catalogue is in place. It also assumes that the user has sufficient credentials to access the catalogue. The catalogue would return sufficient information to enable the client to determine the protected access point and the required security credentials needed to obtain the service capabilities document.

NOTE
The credentials to access the catalogue might be different from the credentials to access the service.
5.6. Use Case V: Use of cached Capabilities instance documents

This use case does not build upon the existence of a catalogue service. It is assumed that a client loads the Capabilities instance document stored on a file system to configure access to a protected OGC Web Service. This approach is not recommended as outlined in section “Security Considerations” (see 10), because the integrity of such a document is not guaranteed. As a result, the Capabilities instance document might violate the need-to-know principle, as an arbitrary “Content” section could be included.

From a client application’s point of view, the entire content might have been tampered with. Therefore, it can only be safe to ignore these capabilities. The application should not even request a fresh copy of the Capabilities document from the endpoint contained in the Capabilities document as that endpoint could have also been changed to point to some malicious server.

5.7. Use Case VI: Use of Capabilities instance documents hosted on a Web Server

This use case does assume that a public Capabilities instance document exists that can be loaded by the application. In this case, the client application should fetch a trusted fresh copy from the endpoint of the protected service as outlined in the use the public version of the capabilities document.

6. Conformance
Conformance with this standard shall be checked using the applicable requirements of each conformance and requirements class. Compliance can be verified via the normative set of conformance tests, defined in Annex A for the service, in Annex B for the client and Annex C for the OGC management process to maintain authentication codes and to operate an authentication code resolver to obtain their definitions. Section 7 defines the requirements for a service implementation to become compliant; section 8 defines the requirements for a client implementation and section 9 defines the requirements regarding the OGC management.

The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site.

All requirements and Requirements Classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

NOTE
Special attention should be taken as this standard supersedes some requirements defined in OWS Common v1.0, v1.1.0 and v2.0 as well as existing OGC Web Service Implementation Specifications where applicable to ensure establishing of interoperable secured service instances.
The described approach to annotate Capabilities documents for secured service instances is backwards compatible as only existing OWS Common elements from the Capabilities document structure are leveraged. This backwards compatibility enforces a particular use of the element <ows:Constraint>, which is slightly different from the original intent.

In order to conform to this OGC standard, a software implementation shall be compliant to one of the three implementable Requirements Classes defined in the next sections.

The following figure provides a structural overview of the Requirements Classes defined in this standard to implement a complaint service.

OWS Common 2.0 differentiates between an exception that arises inside or outside the service implementation. In the case where the root cause of the error is inside an OGC service implementation, then the HTTP status code and ExceptionReport according to Figure 4 above shall be used. In the case where the root cause of the error is outside the OGC service implementation, then the HTTP status codes – with no ExceptionReport – is to be used. Unfortunately, OWS Common 1.1 – which is the mostly used version – does not differentiate the origin of the root cause. It is also unclear, which HTTP status code is to be used when delivering the ExceptionReport.

In addition, WMS introduces the EXCEPTION/EXCEPTIONS parameter that allows the client to control what the mime type of the exception returned is going to be. This allows including the ExceptionReport into an image.

Regardless of these variations to exception handling, this standard defines a clear separation between the actual OGC Web Services for which exception handling is defined, and the extra exception handling introduced by applying security to a service instance.

OGC web services do not exist in a vacuum. They are built on a set of services and standards, which define the underlying, distributed computing environment as illustrated in Figure 5 below.

image
Figure 4. Processing Metaphor how to achieve interoperability with this standard
Not only do OGC Web Service need to correctly produce and handle exceptions defined in the OGC Standards but they also must correctly produce and handle exceptions in accordance with the standards for each service and protocol layer that the OGC Service is built upon. Therefore, an OGC Web Service which is compliant with this standard must comply with not just the exception handling requirements as defined in this standard, but also with the exception handling requirements of all of the supporting capabilities (protocols and services) which are advertised through the Capabilities document.

Requirement 28
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/sr/http-exception-handling/2
OWS services SHALL respect and implement exception handling for all supporting capabilities (protocols and services) identified through the Capabilities document in accordance with their governing standards.
Requirement 29
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/sr/http-exception-handling/3
A compliant implementation SHALL implement exception handling to use HTTP status codes as mandated by the relevant security standards if the origin is an implemented IA control.

For an XACML policy, the mime-type SHALL be used as registered with IANA and published informational by the IETF in RFC 7061 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7061): application/xacml+xml
Requirement 36

For a GeoXACML policy, the mime-type SHALL be used as registered with IANA and published at https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/geoxacml+xml: application/geoxacml+xml
The implementation leveraging the URL to fetch the access policy must observe the Content-Type of the response to identify whether the policy is XACML or GeoXACML and which version.

_Note: It is not required that the access control layer at the service actually operates on a XACML or GeoXACML policy. However, to ensure interoperability and the ability of the client to determine the access denied case before executing a service, a standards compliant description is required. A proprietary language must not be used. An example where the client could leverage the obtained policy is before uploading tons of features to a WFS-T. In cases where the client has determined “deny” this would simply conserve bandwidth.

</ows:Constraint>
The use of OpenAPI for describing an API can also be used to describe the communication protocols used by an interface of an OGC Web Service. We recognize that this description is not a replacement for the Capabilities document.

However, the main driver for using the OpenAPI format is to provide security constraints for the service instance using a format that is well known in mainstream IT. Particularly important is the ability to provide information about existing security controls. The example below illustrates how to provide additional (meta) information for an OAuth2 protected service instance [4].

Table 34. Example annotation expressing OAuth2 requirement with OpenAPI
type: oauth2

flows:

implicit:

authorizationUrl: https://example.com/api/oauth/dialog

scopes:

authorizationCode:

authorizationUrl: https://example.com/api/oauth/dialog

tokenUrl: https://example.com/api/oauth/token

scopes:

write:pets: modify pets in your account

read:pets: read your pets

This example from the OpenAPI v3.0 specification [5] indicates that the service endpoint requires OAuth2 Access Token released for particular scopes.

In addition to annotating the authentication method as defined in above, additional information can be provided. For example, the service provider might want to let the client know to which SAML2 federation the service belong. This could be achieved by using the identifier urn:ogc:specification:security:1.0:rc:authentication:saml2

8. Conformance for a Client Implementation
In order for the concept of Capabilities with security annotations to work, these annotated Capabilities must be available to the client application with no security challenges involved. The methods describing how to make the annotated Capabilities for a service instance available to the client application vary and depend on many factors. Methods describing how the annotated Capabilities for the service are actually made available to the client application are outside the scope of this standard.

The following steps outline the general approach what a client implementation must do with the annotated Capabilities document:

The client implementation must load the annotated Capabilities. The details how this happens are outside the scope of this standard. But, one typical approach would be that a Capabilities instance document could be downloaded from a public Web Server. Or, the client implementation could load a Capabilities instance document from the file system. Please observe the security considerations as outlined in section 10 of this document.

The Client implementation should interpret the annotated capabilities by parsing the operations metadata to determine its compatibility with the outlined security controls and features of the service.

If the “content” section of the annotated Capabilities document is empty, the client should execute the GetCapabilities operation as published in the annotated Capabilities to get the full Capabilities document and in particular the content section.

If the “content” section is not empty, the client may proceed as usual by calling the service specific operations, e.g. GetMap, GetFeature, etc. The client may call the GetCapabilities operation of the service as outlined in the annotated Capabilities document.

8.1. Client Requirements Classes

A client can implement support for one or more Requirements Classes as defined by this standard:

https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/owsCommon,

https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/wms130 or

https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/wms111.

Each of these Requirements Classes define the parsing of security annotations by obeying the different structures of the Capabilities document.

NOTE
All of these Requirements Classes above have a mandatory dependency to the Requirements Class Common Security that implies to implementation of HTTPS.

A service is already compliant to this standard and has implemented the mandatory Requirements Class HTTPS when all operation endpoints of the service exposed in the Capabilities document are using the URL scheme https. This undoubtedly means that the service is hosted on HTTPS.

Requirement 52

The client SHALL parse the Capabilities document for <ows:Constraint> element(s) to find all Requirements Classes implemented by the service. The parsing SHALL acknowledge the structure of the Capabilities that can be determined by the XML namespace and the name of the root element.
8.2.1. Working with Complete Capabilities

According to Requirement 2 the Capabilities document returned by the service operation GetCapabilities, as outlined in the annotated capabilities document, returns a full capabilities document. Therefore, a client can be sure to work on a full capabilities document only in this case. In the case where security controls are implemented for the GetCapabilities operation their existence is indicated by the relevant security annotations.

Note: In case that security controls are indicated for the GetCapabilities operation (thru <ows:Constraint> elements) the client must overcome the security controls to receive the full capabilities document.

8.2.2. Working with Partial Capabilities

As described in section 5.4 (Use Case III: Protected Service / Private Data / Public Catalogue) it is possible that publicly accessible capabilities include none or a partial “content” section. In these cases, the client must execute the GetCapabilities operation as outlined in the publically accessible version of the capabilities to fetch the full capabilities document. The client can determine partial capabilities by parsing for the absence of the “content” section.

Table 51. Section names and their content (source: OGC #06-121r9, p.25)

Metadata about the data served by this server. The contents and organization of this section are specific to each OWS type, as defined by that Implementation Specification.

Whenever applicable, this section shall contain a set of dataset descriptions, which should each be based on the MD_DataIdentification class specified in ISO 19115 and used in ISO 19119.

Languages
Languages supported by this server. The contents and organization of this section shall be the same for all OWSs.
The “content” section of the Capabilities is represented by different XML elements for different OGC Web Service types:

WMS: <Layer>

WMTS: <Contents>

WCS: <Contents>

WFS: <FeatureTypeList>

In any case, for the annotated capabilities to be present, the Capabilities instance document must at least contain the <ows:OperationsMetadata> element and the mandatory operation GetCapabilities. As illustrated in the use cases in section 2, the “content” part of the capabilities document might be omitted. But how can a client tell that a content section is just partially complete? Based on the current standard, it is not possible for the client to determine whether the content section is just partial. This results in two client side requirements.

Requirement 54
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/cr/clientParsing/3
If the annotated Capabilities document does not contain a “content” section (<Layer> element for WMS or a <FeatureTypeList> element for a WFS or a <Contents> element for WMTS, WCS or WPS), the client implementation SHALL execute the GetCapabilities operation advertised (within the Capabilities document) to fetch the full service capabilities. Note: This assumes that the client implementation is able to function on the advertised security requirements for the GetCapabilities operation.
Requirement 55
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/cr/clientParsing/4
If the “content” section of the annotated capabilities document is not empty, the client implementation SHALL call the GetCapabilities operation of the service to ensure the advertised content is complete.

This Requirements Class describes requirements for the OGC to establish a management process regarding the Authentication Codelist mandated by this standard. OGC is responsible for implementing compliance.

Requirement 60
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/1
OGC SHALL establish a process to maintain and resolve authentication codes as mandated by this Requirements Class.
For ensuring interoperability with authentication methods implemented on a service operation, this standard defines an Authentication Codelist as a normative reference to identify authentication codes. The Authentication Codelist shall be hosted by the OGC. The maintainer of the codes and values of the Authentication Codelist is the OWS Common – Security SWG.

Regarding the interoperability between secured OGC Web Services and client applications, the most important and critical topic is Authentication. The concept of annotated Capabilities allows authentication methods to be declared based on an Authentication Codelist, maintained by the OGC.

Requirement 61
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/2
The Authentication Codelist is an ISO 19119 service metadata compliant Authentication Codelist using the GMX namespace as it is defined in ISO 19139:2007.
Using this namespace and schema structure for the authentication codes ensures that the same authentication codes can be used to annotate service metadata to specify the existence of the IA Control Authentication. In technical terms, this can be achieved to load the Authentication Codelist as an external code list into the metadata document.

Essentially, the Authentication Codelist defined in this standard contains identifiers in different name spaces that can be used in the security annotation for authentication, a human readable description and a link to the standard that defines authentication code. The concept of name spaces is important as it enable the re-use of already defined authentication methods and protocols. For example, HTTP BASIC/DIGEST authentication is defined in the namespace IETF, as defined in RFC 2617. Likewise OAuth Bearer authentication is defined in the IETF namespace and SAML protocols are defined in the OASIS namespace. In case where vendor specific authentication is used, they should be included into the Authentication Codelist and the namespace would indicate that the owner is the 3rd party.

Requirement 62
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/3
Authentication codes SHALL use the namespace that reflects the maintainer of the authentication code.
The maintainer of the Authentication Codelist is the OWS Common - Security SWG. The approval of new authentication codes must be submitted to this SWG via an OGC Change Request: http://ogc.standardstracker.org/.

Requirement 63
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelis/4
New authentication codes for the Authentication Codelist hosted by OGC SHALL be submitted via Change Request to the OWS Common Security SWG.
Requirement 64
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/5
To ensure backwards compatibility of the Authentication Codelist, only new authentication codes SHALL be added to the Authentication Codelist. It is not possible to modify or remove existing codes.
9.1. Authentication Codelist Hosting

A normative version of the Authentication Codelist is hosted and maintained by the OGC.

Requirement 65
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/6
The OGC SHALL host the Authentication Codelist.
Requirement 66
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/7
Hosting URL of the Authentication Codelist SHALL use URL protocol scheme https.
9.2. Initial Authentication Codelist

Requirement 67
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenicationCodelist/8
The Authentication Codelist from Annex D SHALL be used by OGC to setup the version 1.0 of the Authentication Code List Registry.
Requirement 68
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/9
The official Authentication Codelist SHALL be resolvable via the following URI: https://www.opengis.net/def/security/1.0/codelist/authentication
9.3. Authentication Codes

For ensuring interoperability with authentication methods implemented on a service instance, this standard defines URNs in an Authentication Codelist. The Authentication Codelist uses the ISO GMX namespace to enable interoperable use within the security annotations of the service capabilities as well as service ISO metadata.

Note: How to use the authentication codes to annotate ISO metadata is out of scope for this standard.

9.3.1. Authentication Codes defined by IETF

Based on the IANA Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml) the following HTTP authentication methods are defined based on IETF RFCs:

Table 54. IETF defined authentication methods

9.3.3. Authentication Codes defined by OGC

Identifier urn:ogc:def:security:authentication:ietf:5246:client_certificate has the meaning equivalent to that defined in RFC 5246: “This type of authentication is an extension to the TLS handshake as outlined in section 7.4.4: "A non-anonymous server can optionally request a certificate from the client, if appropriate for the selected cipher suite. This message, if sent, will immediately follow the ServerKeyExchange message (if it is sent; otherwise, this message follows the server’s Certificate message)."[RFC 5246] In case the client cannot provide a suitable and valid certificate, no TLS connection gets established”[RFC 5246]

9.4. Requirements Class “Authentication Codelist Registry”

The definition of the authentication code can be resolved from the Authentication Codelist URI via the pattern defined in Requirement 68. The main purpose of the Authentication Codelist Registry is to enable the lookup of authentication code definitions via URL resolving.

image
Figure 5. Informative example of an authentication code entry
As defined in section 7 of this standard, the <ows:Constraint> element uses the <gml:identifier> of the authentication code (urn:ogc:def:security:authentication:ietf:6750:Bearer in the example) to identify the authentication code. For a WMS 1.1.1, WMS 1.3.0 as well as OWS Common v1.1 or v2.0 based Capabilities structure, the <ows:Meaning> allows to fetch the <gml:description> element of the <codeEntry> by specifying the gml:id attribute of the <gmx:CodeDefinition> element.

Requirement 69
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/10
For the URL pointing to the <gmx:CodeDefinition>, the resolver SHALL return a human readable definition of the associated authentication code in mime-type text/html.
Requirement 70
https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/mr/authenticationCodelist/11
The base URL for resolving authentication codes SHALL be https://www.opengis.net/def/security/1.0/codelist/authentication
The recommended URL for resolving an authentication code is to extend the base URI with https://www.opengis.net/def/security/1.0/codelist/authentication/\{gml:id}. For example: https://www.opengis.net/def/security/1.0/codelist/authentication/OAUTH2_BEARER_TOKEN

10. Security Considerations (informative)
Applying this standard to a service endpoint provides the opportunity to expose security metadata into the service Capabilities. The main purpose is to provide an interoperability mechanism such that the client can determine whether the security controls at the service are supported.

10.1. Threat “Tampered Capabilities”

The mechanism of including security metadata into the Capabilities works well if the client could trust the Capabilities. For the purpose of the security considerations, it is best to differentiate if the Capabilities are used as an XML instance document or as the direct response from the service to the GetCapabilities request.

Would this threat lead to vulnerability? Yes, this threat could cause a client to wrongly submit user credentials to a malicious site!

Assuming that the attacker would be able to modify the URL of the service endpoint and assert that the authentication method were HTTP BASIC Authentication (as an example). This would cause the client to submit user credentials with the service request. This vulnerability must be considered high risk, as the client has no means to identify the attack.

10.1.1. Mitigations to this threat:

HTTPS is mandatory for any service instance that is compliant to this standard, it is mandatory to have HTTPS in place. However, the Capabilities document being an XML instance document must not be trusted, as it has no means of protection applied.

10.1.2. Approaches to provide a digital signature to the Capabilities document

The W3C XML Digital Signature is a method to provide integrity to an XML instance document. Applying a digital signature can take place using three methods:

Enveloping Signature

Enveloped Signature

Detached Signature

One of the main objectives to this OGC Web Services Security standard was is to ensure backwards compatibility which leads to the standardized approach: Insert security metadata into existing elements of the Capabilities structure and publish the <ows:Constraint> element within the structure for the service metadata. In order to ensure backwards compatibility for the digital signature as well would only allow using the method enveloped signature. However, the Digital Signature element could not be in the usual place (either first or last element of document root) but would rather have to sit inside the <ExtendedCapabilities> element. Even though putting the digital signature element inside the <ExtendedCapabilities> element is compliant with the W3C Digital Signature recommendation, main stream IT tools would fail, as they look for the signature in the usual / recommended place.

See the Signature element on Line 20 below.

<element name="ExtendedXMLDSigCapabilities" type="ows_security:ExtendedXMLDSigCapabilitiesType" substitutionGroup="wms:_ExtendedCapabilities"/>
</schema>
Conclusion: Applying an enveloped signature as part of the <ExtendedCapabilities> document is possible but not feasible as a specific signature / validation library must be implemented to honor the non-typical position of the signature element.

10.1.3. Recommendation

The client should only trust a GetCapabilities response from a service instance and not a Capabilities instance document obtained from another source. The client can trust the service response, as the communication via HTTPS can be considered secure and that no tampering could have occurred while the response to the GetCapabilities request was submitted to the client.

Perhaps there are other means to secure the Capabilities document, but are considered out of scope for this standard.

10.2. Future Consideration

For the future, it seem to be reasonable to request that a digital signature can be applied to OGC encoding documents; e.g. inside a Capabilities instance document to enable enveloped signatures compliant with the main-stream IT approach (either have the Signature element first or last child of document root). But to secure any OGC instance document, like a FeatureCollection, an OWS Context instance document, etc. it would be necessary to provide an optional element to relevant OGC encoding schemas.

Annex A: Conformance Tests for the Service (normative)
A.1. Conformance Classes

This standard defines three Conformance Classes, illustrated in the figure below.

A.1.1. Conformance Class Test – Level 1

This mandatory test ensures that a service instance is compliant with one of the defined Requirements Classes. As discussed in the standard, each Requirements Class reflects a particular Capabilities structure and therefore, this test has three instantiations.

Figure 7. Master activity diagram for testing Compliance
The first test “Test of HTTPS Compliance” verifies that the service instance, described by the Capabilities is compliant to this specification. As stated in requirement 27, a service instance is compliant if all operation endpoint URLs are based on HTTPS.

A.3. Testing Optional Requirements Classes

There is only one mandatory Requirements Class to be implemented: HTTPS.

All other Requirements Classes are optional. The existence of a Requirements Class assures that the service has implemented the associated requirements. A Requirements Class can identify the implementation of an IA, support for a security feature or the exposure of additional metadata.

In order to be compliant with this standard, the implementation of one or many optional Requirements Class must be inserted into the Capabilities using the mechanism defined by this standard: Use of the <ows:Constraint> element. This standard also refers to such an element as security annotation.

To assure a particular structure of the <ows:Constraint> element, each Requirements Class imports the requirements defined in the Requirements Class “Identifiers”.

Requirements Classes https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/authentication and

https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/cors have dependencies to other Requirements Classes that must be reflected in the tests.

The Requirements Class https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/authentication depends on the Requirements Class https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/http-exception-handling. This ensures that a service endpoint that has implemented HTTP protocol based Authentication (i.e. HTTP Basic) can return a HTTP status code 401 instead of the OWS Common Exception Report in XML as mandated by the OWS Common specification.

The Requirements Class https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/cors depends on the https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/http-methods Requirements Class. This is necessary to ensure that the service endpoint supports required HTTP methods like OPTIONS and HEAD.

A.4. Test Activity Diagram for Optional Requirements Classes

The following activity diagram illustrates the sequence of tests that SHALL be applied to determine compliance with a particular set of Requirements Classes. The activity diagram takes under consideration the dependency of Requirements Classes.

The Requirements Class https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/authentication requires also implementation of https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/http-exception-handling as some authentication protocols rely on support for status code other than those defined by superseded OGC standards. Also authentication protocols cannot process OWS Commons XML Exception Reports. Therefore, testing compliance requires to first test the Authentication and then the support for HTTP Exception Handling.

Annex B: Conformance Tests for the Client (normative)
The purpose of the abstract conformance test is to verify client implementations interacting with a test harness, simulating a service compliant to this standard. The mandatory tests defined in this section target on the client functionality and the interface compliance. However, the tests to not take under consideration the correct processing semantics for client function implementations.

The implementation of an actual service test harness is outside the scope of this standard. However, the test harness must be capable to be configured with compliance for each Conformance Class as defined by this standard. It must also be possible to configure the test harness to produce annotated capabilities with any combination of Requirements Classes.

Important for the client to work with a service compliant to this standard is

full support for HTTPS as defined in

Requirements Class urn:ogc:specification:security:1.0:rc:https and

to work with partial capabilities as defined in Requirements Class https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/clientParsing

The inspection of the client test results cannot take place programmatically. Therefore, a human must compare the actual behavior of the client with the expected behavior as defined in the Conformance Tests for the Client.

Figure 10. Illustration of client functionality for processing the Capabilities document exposed by a compliant service or the test harness
B.1. Conformance Test HTTPS

The only mandatory Requirements Class defined by this standard is urn:ogc:specification:security:1.0:rc:https

This test SHALL be applied to determine that the client is capable to accept a service connection via HTTPS.

B.2. Conformance Test Working on Capabilities with no Content section

The Requirement https://www.opengis.net/spec/security/1.0/req/rc/clientParsing defines a mandatory client behavior that is important to be tested.

When a client receives the Capabilities that does not contain the “content” section, the client must send a GetCapabilities request to the endpoint advertised in the Capabilities.

NOTE
The execution of the GetCapabilities endpoint advertised in the Capabilities might require the client to be compliant with implemented security controls. But assuming the client is a compliant implementation, it must be able to execute the GetCapabilities operation even if protected.
image
Figure 11. Illustration of the test for a client to work on Capabilities with no <Content> section
The pass or failure of this test can be verified by a human when executing the client on the test harness that produces Capabilities with no <Content> section. The verification is possible via listing the resources that are included in the <Content> element. If the client does not display any Layers, Feature types, etc. to select from, this test fails.

Annex C: Conformance Tests for the Authentication Code Resolver (normative)
The purpose of the tests defined in this section is to verify that an Authentication Code Resolver is compliant with this specification. This is in particular important for testing compliance of your own registry when you cannot use the OGC Authentication Code Resolver using your own.

The use of your own Authentication Code Resolver can be installed such that the service constructs annotated capabilities where the resolvable links to load authentication code definitions is pointing to your own resolver.

Positive Conformance

The Resolver must accept any valid URI for fetching an authentication code.

Test 1: Requesting the URL as defined in Requirement 68, the resolver must return the original Authentication Codelist with Content-Type “text/xml”.

Initiate an HTTP GET request using a resolvable URI for a definition included in your Authentication Codelist. The result must be a HTML page with content-type “text/html” including the human readable definition of the authentication code.

Test 2: When using a resolvable URI for an authentication code, the resulting HTML page contains the single authentication code definition referenced by the authentication code.

Negative Conformance

Test: Non existing Authentication Code

When trying to resolve a non-existing authentication code, the Resolver must return HTTP status code 404 with error “Authentication Code not resolvable”.

Annex D: Initial Authentication Codelist (informative)
The official mandatory Authentication Codelist can be resolved via the URI as specified in Requirement 68.

Annex E: Using Authentication Codelist in ISO Metadata (informative)
For completeness, this Annex illustrates the use of the authentication Codelist specified by this standard to describe the existence of an authentication IA control. The authentication Codelist can be imported into the ISO service metadata as an external codelist. Based on that import, the authentication codes can be used to describe access constraints.
